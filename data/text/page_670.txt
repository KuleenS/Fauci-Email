TEXT I JUST RECEIVED:

“Doc, total panic mode setting in . Tony Fauci talking R nought at closer to 5 or 6. Good biotech guys saying it
might not die down in April. People talking about 60% of us will get it ; unstoppable in Africa. I can’t scare people
but this is really bad. I hate bothering you on this but I know I need to take my cue from what you will say on CBS”
