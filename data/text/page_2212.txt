| wanted to convey an idea | had with regard to the coronavirus. It
seems to me that trying to contain the virus as we are doing at
present will be futile. Since the virus can be present for many days
without a person having any symptoms, you would literally need to
test everyone at the same time to determine who has it--an
impossible task.

| have a different thought. We know that the virus is

especially dangerous for the old and/or immunosuppressed. IMO
we should be focusing all of our efforts on keeping that group from
becoming infected. To do so that group should be encouraged to
self-isolate, to limit their social interactions and other groups should
be instructed to avoid them. Sort of a reverse-quarantine idea. All
testing would be cone within those groups and all groups would also
be encouraged to continue with the hygienic suggestions they've
already received.

The problem right now is that the media has created a panic. Last
night my wife and | went to the local Whole Foods and many of the
shelves were empty and healthy younger people were wearing
masks.

The message is not getting out that the virus is almost solely
dangerous to the elderly and immunosuppressed. [Why aren't the
demographics being released? That in itself could calm many
people.] With my suggestion, exposures to them would be
diminished, significantly reducing the number of deaths, as well as
