Dr. Fauci,

First, thank you for all you are doing to keep the public informed in a clear, direct,
and truthful manner. I am writing to offer a suggestion.
The following is a post I just placed on my Facebook page:

It's a 2-step process!!!

We are seeing the ubiquitous pleas for proper hand-washing as a
preventative against contracting the corona virus. BUT...| have observed
people doing a great job of hand-washing, then picking up their dirty cell
phones!! The cell phone should FIRST be wiped down using a disinfecting
wipe (do NOT use sprays or household cleaning supplies). After cleaning the
phone, THEN do a proper 20 second hand-washing. Now, CARRY ON!

Step 2: Proper Hand Washing

I honestly do not see people disinfecting their cell phones. I am active in our
(___ ©} community and am trying to get this information across to people in
the community. They have told me it was helpful and something they had not
considered. I thought it would be helpful for me to share with you.

Best Regards,
