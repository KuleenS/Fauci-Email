Subject: We Are Desperate for Advice

 

Dear Tony, Bob and Deb et al,

The AIDS experts among you know me well. We’ve been first adversaries then colleagues for over 30
years.

They also know I can’t keep my mouth shut, which is a virtue and a failing, depending on the context.
Now:

There are thousands of people waiting for advice from our federal government on broader social
distancing measures in light of the fact that our failure in early testing and surveillance means the
coronavirus is likely already spreading in our communities.

If you thought the ire of AIDS activists 30 years ago was tough, the anger now spreading among
researchers, scientists, clinicians and activists is going to be a conflagration.

All we see is genuflection in word and deed from most of you to a White House that wants this all to
magically go away.

Yes, | know you’re all doing your best and behind the scenes our federal government is hard at work. For
those | know, | don’t doubt your commitment to public service.

But time is running out.

We need vocally, unequivocal leadership now, that offers real guidance to communities about what to
do, what might happen next.

Your own legacies will be defined by this moment, what you do and what you don’t, what you shy away
from saying because you fear for your jobs or your short-term fortunes in the eyes of the President.
The status quo is untenable.

It’s going to get people killed by this virus.

Gregg
