Thanks for the chance to weigh in. | have it blocked on my calendar and would look forward to the
discussion. And I’m happy to pull slides together as outlined.

Here are some minor comments on the agenda, which looks excellent.
Looking forward to it,

Hilary

Hi Hilary,

I’ve been through the COVID-19 ideas collected from your Deputies meeting, plus reaching out for a few
other inputs. What | hope to do is to assemble this into a lively three-hour discussion on Wednesday
afternoon (2-5 PM). Tony is enthusiastic about our doing this, but his presence is unfortunately
doubtful, given all of the other demands he faces. |’m counting on you and Cliff to be there, however —
is this etched on your calendars?
