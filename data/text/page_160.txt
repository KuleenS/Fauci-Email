Dear Mr. Fauci,

This may be way too presumptive of a note...
As an engineer I've always liked to understand the mechanics of how things work so | looked into
educating myself about the coronavirus and it's mechanics.Eo GG)

CS _) I've correlated a possible research route for your organization regarding the
prevention aspect.

A quick overlook on this strategy is the following:
Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that typically enter human cells when their glycoproteins bind
proteins on the cell surface. In the case of the virus that causes SARS, that human protein 1s

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). At this time, scientists think the novel coronavirus 1s
similar enough to SARS that its entry point is likely ACE2 as well.
