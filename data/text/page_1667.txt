> Hi Tony, You probably don’t remember me, I was {GY J husband back when she was at NIH, you
came to dinner at our house once. We also hung out in Boulder and drank beer together. I am just a working class
guy, but keep up with science and politics for what it is worth. I don’t know what you hear from the street level, but
from here in. NY we are pretty concerned with the risk of Covid-19 and the Federal response to the pandemic. You
have been the only reasonable voice in the administration. The leadership from the top is utterly lacking and
incompetent and dangerous to the American people. You have had a long and venerable career and I am asking you
to stand up to power and speak the harsh truth to the people of this country and the without regard to your personal
consequences. We need a unified and professional federal response to this unprecedented crisis. I think you may be
the only person of repute and status that has the power to change the course of history. I have spoken with a good
fricnd of mine who is a respected epidemiologist and he said that Covid-19 will infect half the population of the
world and those numbers are frightening statistically. My dad was born during the first worldwide modern pandemic
and I don’t really want to see him leave from this current one. I know I am somewhat out of place writing to you,
but one can only do what one can do to influence the events that history arises from. With utmost respect. Tony
