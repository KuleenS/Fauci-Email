your query about the possible use of OPV to activate innate immunity and provide
COVID-19 protection. Has this been tested in a non-human primate model? I note
the recommendation below that says a clinical trial is planned — can you tell me
more about that?

As you can imagine, we are all flat out on the vaccine development pathway!

The use of oral polio vaccine (OPV) to prevent SARS-CoV2 (Polio Eradication
Campaign)

There is no evidence that ora! poliovirus vaccine (OPV) protects people against
infection with COVID-19 virus.

A clinical trial addressing this question is planned in the USA, and WHO will
evaluate the evidence when it is available.

In the absence of evidence, WHO does not recommend OPV vaccination for the
prevention of COVID-19. WHO continues to recommend OPV as part of essential
immunization services to prevent poliomyelitis and as part of global polio
eradication efforts.

There are experimental signa's from various studies over the years that OPV has
non-specific effects on the immune system. These effects have not been well
characterized and their clinical relevance is unknown. Such non-specific effects may
