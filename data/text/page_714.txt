FIG 1 Common pathways of susceptibility to postinfluenza bacterial superinfections. Early after influenza virus infection, mice show reduced susceptibility to
superinfection that ts at least in part due to increased production of IL- 13. This IL-14-nich environment does not permit IFN-y production, allowing unaltered
phagocytosis and clearance of bacteria. The role for either neutrophils or macrophages ( phagocytes) in hacterial dearance early during influenza virus infection
has not been fully investigated. Progression of influenza virus infection results in increased suscepubility to secondary infection. Type L IFN (or [L-27) signaling
initiated in response to influenza virus infection results in downregulated production of IL- 16 and [1-23 and impaired type 17 immune responses. Inhibition of
IL-17 and IL-22 reduces production of antimicrobial peptides. Tvpe | IFN signaling also reduces levels of neutrophil chemoattractants Cxdl and Cxcl2 and can
induce formation of NETs. IL-27 induced during influenza virus infection further suppresses IL-17 production but stimulates production of regulatory cytokine
IL-10, which contributes to increased susceptibility to superinfection, presumably by alteration of the anti-influenza inflammatory response. IAV, influenza A
virus infection.
