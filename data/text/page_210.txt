Dear Dr Fauci,

Hope this mail finds you well. We had the opportunity to meet in Madrid during the R4P
meeting. I was the local chair of the Conference and had the privilege of introducing your talk to
the plenary.

I would like to invite you as plenary speaker to the meeting of the Spanish AIDS Society

(GESIDA) that will take place in Malaga, Spain next 30" November 2020. GESIDA Congress is
the most important HIV national meetings in Spain that brings together the full “HIV
Community” including clinicians, basic researchers, experts in epidemiology and public health
and member from NGOs and patients’ associations. Overall 700 attendees are expected to come
to the meeting.

We would love to have you as a speaker in the Opening Plenary Session in evening the 30"
November. Your challenging articles regarding the strategies to end the HIV epidemic in the
United States, will be a great topic to be addressed in such session and an inspiration to Spanish
researchers. If you prefer to talk about a different topic as the co-morbidities scenario in HIV
infection it will be welcome too.

We would be more than happy if you could participate in this meeting.

If know your agenda is always full, even more these days with the current Coronavirus outbreak,
