This paper asks the question of why do individuals mount variable immune responses to vaccines,
infections, and diseases. This extends from our earlier work on baseline predictors of influenza
vaccination responses that you highlighted as a NIAID Advance in 2014. A key message is that genetics is
often unlikely the answer, but the status of the immune system before the perturbation may offer clues
— here we identified such an immune cell circuit involving pDCs-Type | IFNs prior to perturbation in
humans and found that its status can predict vaccination and lupus disease activities and is temporally
stable within individuals for months.

 

Many thanks!

Best wishes,
John.
