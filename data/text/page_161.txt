Irbesartan is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and to help protect the kidneys from
damage due to diabetes. Lowering high blood pressure helps prevent strokes, heart attacks,

and kidney problems. Irbesartan belongs to a class of drugs called angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARBs). It works by relaxing blood vessels so that blood can flow more easily.

Idea:
Can Irbesartan, being an angiotensin receptor blocker, possibly help prevent Coronavirus infections...
since the Coronavirus entry to humans is via ACE-2?

| share this suggestion with you in the hopes that it may help your department in the research to
prevent the spread of the coronavirus... or to a presumptuous email slated for deletion.
