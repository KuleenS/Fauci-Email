Dear Dr Anthony S Fauci,

This is Zachary from BBC Chinese.

| am now writing a piece regarding the treatment of people in isolation or quarantine over coronavirus
in different countries.

Most of the countries told the public where the people evacuated from Wuhan reside for quarantine
and some drew local’s protests. They expressed concern over close vicinity and some even went to
protest in these places.

Others like Taiwan, the authority decided to keep the quarantine location confidential. The reason is to
avoid unnecessary worrisome and let people rest well.

| would like to have an interview with you by e-mail or Skype phone with you to give some insights or
comments on this issue.

If you could be quoted, the questions are as below

1. Why does the government tell the public the quarantine location? Is it necessary? Or why not?
