Re: Following
up on NIH
visit

Hi Anne,

Thanks for
your email and
offer to
assist with
other
interviews.

I'm "old
school," and
see merit in
building
relationships
with
researchers
and hearing
about their
work without
the
expectation of
necessarily
getting a
story.

My interests
are pretty
eclectic --
from
antimicrobial
resistance to

NIH-001411
