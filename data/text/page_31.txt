As promised, here is the big ticket item I wanted to flag for you. I was waiting to get through
yesterday’s hits to loop you in as to not overwhelm you. I have been speaking with the WH and
VP’s office to see if Dr. Fauci is available to join CNN this Thursday for our global town hall but
wanted to make sure you have the info. Would you mind checking to see if he’s avail’?
