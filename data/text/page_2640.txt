evacuation flights, the statement
said.

"After consultation with HHS
officials, including experts from
the HHS Office of the Assistant
Secretary for Preparedness and
Response, the State Department
made the decision to allow the 14
individuals, who were in isolation,
separated from other passengers,
and continued to be asymptomatic,
to remain on the aircraft to
complete the evacuation process,"
the agencies said.

One charter flight carrying
evacuated Americans arrived at
Travis Air Force Base near
Fairfield, California, around 11:28
p.m. local time Sunday. A second
arrived at Joint Base San Antonio-
Lackland in San Antonio, Texas at
3:56 a.m. local time Monday.

The passengers who tested
positive were isolated from the
other passengers during the
flights, the statement said. And all
passengers are being "closely
monitored" throughout the flight.

"Any who become symptomatic
will be moved to the specialized
containment area, where they will
be treated,” the statement said.

After the flights land, any
passengers that developed
symptoms on the flights and those
who had already tested positive
will be transported to "an
appropriate location for continued
isolation and care."
