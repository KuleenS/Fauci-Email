Dr. Fauci:

I appreciated your office calling me last Thursday regarding my email concern
below on the Covid 19 virus epidemic. The fact that China has a larger percentage
of smokers in its population may have something to do with the faster spreading of
the virus there. Male smokers out number females by a huge number and are
therefore dying in much higher numbers because of that fact.

Has anyone at CDC looked into when a person is around cigarette smokers that the
particles of smoke land onto a persons clothing. That person then comes home with
those smoke particles on their clothing and they can be shed when the clothes are
removed from their body thus placing the possible virus laden particles back into the
air at home to infect others. Just smell your clothes the next day and you can no
doubt smell smoke on them. Has this case in point been looked into as a possible
means of spreading the virus? Since a side effect of the virus 1s the patient
developing pneumonia would giving an elderly person the Prevar 13 shot help
strengthen their immune system before the virus ever strikes them?

I wish you &other virologist God Speed with finding a vaccine that will stop the
spread of this epidemic.
