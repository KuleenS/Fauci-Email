Subject: Re: WHO advance team on coronavirus on way to China - Tedros tweet
Hi Garrett,

We have three people on the way to Beijing who will work with our Chinese counterparts on finalizing
the TOR and composition of the joint WHO - China mission. As you are much aware, the US has given us
a number of names who will be able and willing to join such a mission. We have received similar
proposals from other countries and will now match the “long list” of experts with the required specific
expertise.

We are hoping to have more clarity over the coming days and will obviously keep you in the loop. The
overall number will be kept at a level to make sure that the team is fully operational.

With my warmest wishes
Bernhard

Bernard,
Hope you had a good weekend.

I’m reaching out to get more clarity on the WHO experts team issue —
please see article below. I’ve heard everything from an advance group
of one or two individuals to 15 people discussed in the article. | haven't
heard any word about US people, and | was just with Dr Redfield late
this afternoon and he was in the dark too.
