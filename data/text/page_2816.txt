Hi Tony,

I need a Fauci brain dump.

You may have seen this:
https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=12307276

 

Is this news? Don’t we already know that the virus spread via droplet transmission? This article says aerosol
transmission means “it can float a long distance to the air and cause infection later when it is breathed in.” That
makes it sound like the kind of spread that happens with measles, wherc the virus can linger in a room and infect
somebody 2 hours after somebody with measles leaves the room.

Tomorrow, I will be giving an hour and a half of affiliate debriefings on this virus. So we will be reaching millions
of people. I'd love to get the latest and greatest public health message. Incidentally, Howard Zucker and the
infectious disease folks at NYU Langone are very concerned about overloading our emergency rooms with patients
who have upper respiratory infection symptoms. What is the right message? If somebody calls thinking they have
coronavirus, do you tell them to come in — risking infection of others? Do they stay home and wait for symptoms to
get worse? Of course, it would be great if you could send them a kit and happen to home testing. But that’s nowhere
in the near future, right?
