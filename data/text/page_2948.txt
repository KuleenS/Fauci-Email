Jeremy:

Thanks for the note. Looks like things are moving along with WHO. I will list below a
number of names for potential members of the working group to examine the evolutionary origin
of the 2019-nCoV in addition to the individuals who were on the call with us last Saturday:

Harold Varmus — Weill Cornell Medical Center - New York City

Feng Zhang — MIT (CRISPR expert)

Joseph DeRisi - Chan Zuckerberg (CZ) BioHub (he’s paying close attention to the Wuhan
strain vs other bat viruses and the SARS virus)
