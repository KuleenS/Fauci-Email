Dear Dr. Fauci,

On behalf of the International Cytokine and Interferon Society, please find attached a letter from us

as clinicians and scientists committed to developing and implementing therapeutic interventions targeted
against global viral infection outbreaks. We propose that high priority be given to evaluating the
therapeutic antiviral activities of IFN-as/bc(clinically approved formulations) against COVID-19 which
poses a potential threat to global health. Further information 1s detailed in the attached. The ICIS would
be happy to provide the scientific and clinical expertise for this program and welcome further discussion.
In particular Dr. Eleanor Fish copied above has the track record and expertise in this area.

Sincerely,

Kate A. Fitzgerald | Professor of Medicine
President | International Cytokine and Interferon Society (ICIS)
