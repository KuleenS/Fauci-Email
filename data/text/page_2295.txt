Subject: Funding, for Dr. Fauci

Responsiveness to emerging infectious disease threats is important. However, | worry that increasing
funding is going away from global health priorities. It appears that the US Ending the HIV Epidemic has
already diverted funding within NIH from global work to domestic. Will the NIH response to COVID-19
only worsen funding available for global health?

Thanks,
Rena
