Hi Dr Fauci,

 

I'm sure you are swamped. I'll be brief. | am CEO of the world's leading provider of dispensing
equipment for the diagnostics market, BioDot Inc. We have been around for 25 years and provide
enabling technology to virtually every rapid immunoassay and molecular diagnostics company in the
world. We are actively involved today with companies around the globe to help commercialize lateral
flow point of care products to help fight Covid-19. If there is anybody in your organization or on the task
force that could help facilitate getting us involved with companies looking to produce tests - we are here
to help! For example we are actively working with Biomedomics to get their LFD test into the
community as fast as possible.

We will move heaven and earth to help the country in any way we can.

Thank you for all you have done and best of luck in fighting this pandemic
