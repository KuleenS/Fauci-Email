prediction model based on real-time RT-PCR Ct value. Findings: The Result showed that cases with
RNAaemia were exclusively confirmed in critically ill patients group and appeared to reflect the illness
severity. Further more, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in critically ill
patients, which is almost 10-folds higher than those in other patients. More importantly, the extremely
high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the incidence of RNAaemia (R=0.902) and the vital signs of
COVID-19 patients (R= -0.682). Interpretation: Serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is strongly
associated with cytokine storm and can be used to predict the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients.
Moreover, our results strongly suggest that cytokine IL-6 should be considered as a therapeutic target in
critically ill patients with excessive inflammatory response.
