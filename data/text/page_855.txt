| would like to ask you two questions: What is most crucial now to suceed with an covid-19
pandemic exit in the US? How do you find the Swedish strategy against Covid-19 so far (Dr.
Mike Ryan praised it yeasterday at the WHO press conference as a model for an exit strategy,
what is your view)?

In this one hour program aired on May 11th we will have other prominent scientists as well
talking about exit strategies, among others Nobel prize winner prof. Paul Krugman, prof. Bengt
Holmstrém MIT, prof. Angus Deaton Princeton, as well as Prof Gabriel Leung Dean University
Hongkong etc.

Here you can see the reports | did from my earlier interview with you about the zika epidemic
in 2016 (in Swedish). News report: https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/6420891 20 min
documentary: https://sverigesradio.se/avsnitt/712016

One option is that | send you a link for a web video Conference call. Another option is that | call
you on the phone and your media department may have the oportunity to record a video of
your anseers with HD quality that is better to air.

Please let me know if you are available and when.
Best regards,
