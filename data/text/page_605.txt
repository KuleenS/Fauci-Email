Tony,
Our thoughts and prayers are with you as you professionally address the horrid coronavirus transmission.

We salute you for not “sugarcoating™ or trying to be “diplomatic” about the Diamond Princess Cruises ship
quarantine process.

As always, you proved yourself to be a courageous, honest and ethical man. A man who has always done the right
things.

We stand with you!
In Hoc Signo Vinces,

Denny and Monica Golden
