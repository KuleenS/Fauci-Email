Dr. Fauci- Of course, | appreciate how busy you are, so just reaching out again on behalf
of the American College of Cardiology as noted below. We were hopeful we could steal
just an hour of your time in June for an important discussion on COVID-19 and exercise
training. This is part of a virtual agenda for one of our national conferences (Care of the
Athletic Heart) with outreach around the world given this is a part of the ACC
educational platform.

We hope this is something you have the bandwidth for, and simply appreciate your
consideration. | hope to hear from you and thank you for all your service once again.

My best, Jonathan Kim
