Hi Tony,

just a short notice to tell you that you are becoming even more popular in Italy as your face and
interviews are everywhere on the main Italian broadcasting news and journals.

It seems like to be in USA again for me, as | see you every day and | can tell you are doing well although
you must be overwhelmed with all this. | was supposed to be at NIH in tre weeks from now, but | have
cancelled the flight and travel due to highest restrictions from CDC and HHS for Italian travellers from
Lombardia and Veneto (and | live in Milan).

Can we estimate how long all this will last? Weeks or months according to you knowledge?

Hope to see you soon anyway and I really hope U.S. outbreak will not turn as bad as the Italian one.
Indeed, Milan is living a real unprecedented (for modern time) and surrealistic situation with a mix of
fear, panic and incredulity among people. It almost seems a movie! The government shut down half
country by closing all schools and universities, by not allowing meetings of any kind, by limiting travels in
many places and by placing severe restrictions in social life. They even stopped the Fashion week in
Milan that is a big thing here.

Maybe too late, but they didi it and we hope it will work somehow to reach a plateau in contagious.

have a nice day

Ciao

Domenico
