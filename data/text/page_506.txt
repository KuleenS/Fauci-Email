Good afternoon.

Just wanted to write and say how much! deeply appreciate your on-going public service; you’ve made
extraordinary contributions over the course of your career and, as I’ve watched you on TV in the context
of the current public health threat of the coronavirus, | know you’re continuing to co so...

No need to respond; you have a lot going on.

From one citizen and a former colleague, extending my thanks and deep appreciation.

Best wishes.
