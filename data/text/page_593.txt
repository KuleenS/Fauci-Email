Your hypothesis is certainly possible, but | think unlikely. In a NEJM paper for
which | have just written an editorial, there were 400+ patients and none younger
than 15 years old. | am certain that children from birth to 15 years were exposed
to and primed by coronaviruses multiple times and so if 2nd infection
enhancement were an important issue, we should have seen it in children and
adolescents 15 years old and younger. Just a thought, but anything is possible.
