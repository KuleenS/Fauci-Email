I think he probably knows Bob Franken personally so I'm wondering if you might want to flag this for him, as he
might decide it warrants a personal response.

Otherwise, he did speak about health disparities at yesterday's WH press conference, and we could certainly point
Franken to those comments and then also direct him to NIMHD | OC]
