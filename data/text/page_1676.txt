Hi Tony, | just want to express my sincere gratitude for all you are doing
to get us through this crisis. Everyone I’ve talked to at RML expresses
their deep admiration and appreciation for your strong leadership, and
we feel proud to be working for you. We listen to your hoarse voice
every day. Personally, | have started two new lines of research to
develop and test possible therapeutics for COVID-19. The cooperation
and collaboration from everyone I’ve talked to, both here and around
the nation, has been unbelievable. Please take care of yourself and stay
strong and healthy for the sake of all of us!

Best regards,
Kim
