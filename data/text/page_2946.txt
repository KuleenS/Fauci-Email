Tak:

Thanks for the note. It likely will be more efficient if | refer you to the program
people in my Institute who could go over these data with you and then get me
involved later. The reason that is that | am doing 18 hours pe day (seriously) as
part of the White House Task Force and it would very difficult for me to fit in a
meeting to go over data. | have copied Dr. Cristina Cassetti who runs our
coronavirus extramural research program. | will ask her by this e-mail to contact
you to have our people discuss your work with you.

Best regards,
Tony
