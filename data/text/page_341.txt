Subject: Questions about the coronavirus—Chinese Media Inquiry:
Dear Dr Fauci,

My Name is Paul Xin, I’m a journalist from Pengpai News(ThePaper) of Shanghai, which is one of the
most important new medai in China. |'m Sorry to bother you as you must be very busy. | noticed your
comment about coronavirus on American media, | deeply hope you could answer few of my
questions.Your answers will be very helpful to me. The questions are below.

Thank you very much!

Sincerly,
Paul Xin

1/You said on CNN that US have had pandemic preparedness plan that developed in preparation for
pandemic influenza. Could you provide some details of this plan? The plan outlines the differences
between containment and mitigation. It speaks of the thing that should be done if an outbreak
occurs in the USA. Thes inclue social distancing, use of telecommunication and telework, temporarily
closing schools, avoiding crowed places such as indoor arenas and theaters.

2/To prepare for potential communities spread of coronavirus in US, do you think that US need take the
measures similar with China? China was in the “reactive” mode of responding to an explosion of cases
in Wuhan City and Hubei province with spread throughout China. China had to resort to very
dramatic measures such as shutting down cities. The USA is nowin a preparative mode and nota
reactive mode and so our response is much different than that of China.
