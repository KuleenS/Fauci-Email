Mechanism of action[edit]

The mechanism of its actions is thought to be related to the selective inhibition of viral RNA-
dependent RNA polymerase.!! '] Other research suggests that favipiravir induces lethal RNA

transversion mutations, producing a nonviable viral phenotype.l!2] Favipiravir is a prodrug that
is metabolized to its active form, favipiravir-ribofuranosyl-S'-triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP),

available in both oral and intravenous formulations.!!3J['4] Human hypoxanthine guanine

phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) is believed to play a key role 1n this activation process.|!>!
Favipiravir does not inhibit RNA or DNA synthesis in mammalian cells and is not toxic to
them.l4] In 2014, favipiravir was approved in Japan for stockpiling against influenza
pandemics.!!6] However, favipiravir has not been shown to be effective in primary human

airway cells, casting doubt on its efficacy in influenza treatment.|!7]

Approval status[edit]

In 2014, Japan approved Favipiravir for treating viral strains unresponsive to current

antivirals, |!8] Toyama Chemical initially hoped that Avigan would become a new influenza drug
that could replace Tamiflu. However, animal experiments show the potential for teratogenic
effects on fetuses, and the approval of production by The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare

was greatly delayed and the production condition is limited only in an emergency in Japan_l9]

In March 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration completed a Phase III clinical trial
studying the safety and efficacy of Favipiravir in the treatment of influenza.[20]
