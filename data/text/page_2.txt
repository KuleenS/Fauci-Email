Subject: National Blood Supply

Dear Dr. Fauci: | am an ex-alumni from the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the NIH. | am sorry to
bother but | wanted to notify the Coronavirus Task force about potential blood shortages if blood
centers get blood drive cancellations due to the fear in the public.

We are starting to see this locally and my concern is that other blood centers in the country are facing
the same issue.

| tried to contact the office of the vice president, and all! could do was to send an email, which might
get lost among thousands.

| am hoping you see this and perhaps bring this to the table. Blood centers use updated federal
information when educating donors, staff and hospitals but the current fear is triggering blood drive
cancellations. This might be experienced nationally and will impact the national blood inventory.

Thank you
