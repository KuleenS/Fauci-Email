Subject: PBS Nature inquiry about Coronavirus
Hi Dr. Fauci,

Hari Sreenivasan of PBS NewsHour suggested I reach out to you with a specific nature question that
we’re writing about. | hope you'll be able to give us some insights — I’m sure you’re extremely busy!

We're wondering about the impact of animals on the virus and specifically, why now? Presumably, China
has been using animal markets/wildlife trade in these exact ways for a while, so what changed or is
different now to cause this illness and outbreak? Any other information you can provide on how animals
are involved would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!

Best,
Danielle Steinberg
