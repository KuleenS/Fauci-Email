Tony,

Here are reconfigured charts which factor in the guidance from mathematicians at Rockefeller. As you can see, the
trend in the U.S. is visibly worse. If this pattern holds, we're going to see many more deaths before things get better.

We would be grateful for a comment. Could you offer a perspective? We're going to try to publish today.
