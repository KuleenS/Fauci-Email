Subject: RE: NAS Annual Meeting Session on COVID-19 -- Information regarding your Saturday April 25
participation

 

Dear all,

Thank you for agreeing to participate in a special late breaking session on the COVID-19
pandemic at the NAS annual mecting. Knowing how busy you arc, | am sending this email in
lieu of a call to prepare for the session.

As you know, this is a 90 minute session which aims to provide our audience with deeper
insights into the latest developments in the COVID-19 response. I plan to hold an engaging
discussion that covers the whole experience on dealing with this pandemic — from US to
international, to preparedness and response, the biology of the virus, the state of diagnostic,
treatment and vaccine development, and the importance of communication.

I will begin the session by providing brief (~3 min) opening remarks describing the
circumstances of the pandemic. Then, I will introduce the panelists and you will each have 7
minutes to provide remarks. You may use a limited number of slides for illustration. I hope that
each panelist will provide their own perspective and speak to the issues proposed below.
