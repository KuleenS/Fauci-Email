Hi guys — as a huge Nats fan, Dr. Fauci very much wants to do this chat with Ryan
Zimmerman. Can | get a green light to work on this with them? I’ll get the q’s but it will be
the same general theme as with Steph Curry, YES Network, etc.

Absolutely! We would 100% be able to work around that and avoid any association of
fundraising.

We would set this up however he will be most comfortable, seed questions in advance, etc.
and shed a light on what is most helpful.

Will wait to hear and if you need anything else just let us know. Thank you so much!
