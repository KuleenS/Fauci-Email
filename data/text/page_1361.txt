Subject: Support for a "U, S. COVID-19 Response Corps"

Hi Tony,

Greetings from

It’s been good to see all the calls for ramping up a public health workforce to manage contact tracing
and other aspects of the second phase of the response. | wanted to let you know that Peter Kilmarx has
been calling for the formation of a “U.S. COVID-19 Response Corps” since March 21 (unrelated to NIH
work). FEMA could hire thousands of temporary workers quickly with existing authorities and funding.
CDC could provide training and technical assistance. The workforce would be deployed to and managed
by state and local health departments at their request. There’s a lot of enthusiasm for this from Jeff
Duchin in Seattle, to Tom Frieden, CSIS, ASTHO, and 40 members of Congress (bicameral, bipartisan)
who sent a letter to FEMA asking them to do this. The 7,000+ recently evacuated Peace Corps
volunteers could be one recruiting source. Another approach is for CDC to fund state and local
authorities for those who are able to hire at this speed and scale. There’s more information in the string
below.

This workforce issue is now such a critical part of the response, | wanted to share with you what
we've learned and offer to help in any way.

Tony, all of NIH is so proud of your leadership and rooting for you to get this outbreak under control.
Please keep up fight and let us know if and how we can help.

Warm wishes,
Roger
