Subject: Invitation to Speak at US-Asia Institute Event: February 26, Washington DC

 

Good afternoon,

The US-Asia Institute would like to formally invite Director Dr. Anthony Fauci to speak at an event on
February 26 in Rayburn House Office Building, Room 2253, at 1:00 pm. Our formal invitation is
attached.

This event will focus on the public health impacts of the novel coronavirus, the facts on the ground,
trajectory of the virus, and work to contain the outbreak. The event aims to educate Congressional staff
on these topics and to dispel rumors associated with the virus. We believe that Director Dr. Fauci's
current research is vital to supporting productive and informative dialogue.

Please let us know if Director Dr. Fauci, or another NIAID representative, is available to participate in this
event. We would be honored to host him or others from NIAID and our audience would be extremely

interested to learn from your agency's research.

Sincerely,
Zev Moses
