Dr. Fauci:

This is Dr. Rick Sawaya :

Dr. Tom Betz is FF and his training is more in line with yours than mine.

He submitted this mini-endorsement to you for me and my work. He has seen most of my works

and the NIH data protocol from 2016-2017.

| think his background gives credibility to my ideas and lends a public health opinion which | did not have
until

calling him.

Hope you enjoy this.
| have treated cancers, herpes, acne easily with this stuff and honestly and confidentially
it will do anything but your income tax.

Thanks, Rick Sawaya M.D.

Ce)

call between 10am and 10pm EST,

Rick,

| am attaching suggested notes for NIH. They may think we're both crazy but | imagine you have already
been down that road and |'m interested to see what happens. Hang in there,
