Subject: Question re: coronavirus infection & pneumococcal vaccination

 

Dear Dr. Fauci,
This is Manon Cox, former CEO of Protein Sciences, the developer of Flublok® .

First of all | would like to thank you for your realistic comments around the ongoing
coronavirus outbreak. | am glad to see that not everyone is presenting a “Spanish Flu”- like
scenario.

| am reaching out to you b/c lam noticing that so many people including professionals
(MD’s!) appear to be thinking that people with a coronavirus infection are dying from a
cytokine storm whereas my understanding is that pneumonia (whether viral or bacterial) is
generally the underlying of the lung failure.

My question to you is: Do we know whether people that have previously received a
pneumococcal vaccination might be better protected from death after contracting a severe
coronavirus infection? i.e., would it be possible that the coronavirus causes tissue damage
resulting in a secondary pneumococcal infection?

| know better than anyone (after working over 15 years on Flublok approval) that it is not
realistic to expect a coronavirus anytime soon but if we could message that a
pneumococcal vaccine could be beneficial in ultimate outcome it would be good for

vaccines in general as we do have pneumovax and Prevnar available.

Thank you for your consideration.
