Dr. Fauci. This is Lei Harrison. In the coronavirus crisis, as a former

I have been calm until now. No one
can anymore after seeing the photos of the international airports today
where hundreds if not thousands of people standing in line for 5-6 hours
and realizing immediately the virus transmission will explode
exponentially because of this. I strongly request:

1. Shut down the country NOW. Mobility has to be as low as
possible. We have to do the very best RIGHT NOW to break the
transmission chain.

2. Please talk to Dr. Zhong Nanshan (#44 Ll) , the Chiense
doctor and advisor during the coronavirus crisis. His advice and
experience would be of tremendous value for the U.S. now.

3. Sofar, we’ve been acting in a reactive instead of proactive
fashion. Not anymore. People need to realize that we are entering
war time. We need to act fast, in light speed to beat the virus.

4. Healthcare workers need to most strongly protected- treat it as
airborne if needed at the hospitals and pharmacies. Supplies of
essential protective medical supplies for healthcare workers are
equally important as supplies needed for the patients. Make sure
supply chain from China is uninterrupted; and have American
companies to start making masks, ventilators etc. Plan ahead.
