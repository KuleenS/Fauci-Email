INFECTION CONTROL

The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus will raise

questions about how to limit the spread of respiratory
infections.

Managing this situation is similar to outbreaks of SARS and
MERS...Since coronaviruses are spread by respiratory secretions.

Put the risk in perspective to calm worried
patients...since it doesn’t come close to the risk of influenza.

For example, over 35 MILLION U.S. patients got the flu last
season...with about 500,000 hospitalizations and 34,000 deaths.

Emphasize getting a flu vaccine each year.

And use this coronavirus outbreak as an opportunity to
stress infection control...since there’s no treatment or vaccine
yet.

Reinforce proper hand hygiene. Educate that handwashing
with soap and water is the best way to get rid of germs. Advise

washing for 20 seconds...about the time it takes to sing the ABC
song.

Or recommend using a hand sanitizer with at least 60%
alcohol if handwashing isn’t practical. Many products contain
this much.

But tell patients to be wary of efficacy claims. For
example, hand sanitizers are shown to kill enveloped viruses.
Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses...but they aren’t
specifically studied.
