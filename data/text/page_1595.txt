Sounds good, Dr, Fauci - we greatly appreciate the effort that you/Cliff and your team
have put into this.

Look forward to receiving and discussing the guidelines (no need for a separate meeting
with me first - we can go straight to the Secretary) and agree that they will not be
subjected to additional layers of formal clearance given the circumstances.
