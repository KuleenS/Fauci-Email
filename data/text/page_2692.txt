Subject: WaPo - fact check on coronavirus story
Hey Caitlin and Katie,

Happy Friday! I’m working ona story about the coronavirus response, aiming to publish tomorrow. The
Story is about how President Trump has praised China and President Xi, but that has made some of his
advisors uncomfortable given the lack of transparency from China and the inability to get CDC scientists
in to the country. We also have some details about the response and the task force, and some
disagreements that have arisen. I’ve listed the points we have in the story that pertain to HHS — would
you be able to take a look, let me know if there are any issues and potentially provide a comment? |
included some quotes from Sec. Azar’s interviews on Friday with CNN and CNBC but also happy to
include a quote from the agency.
