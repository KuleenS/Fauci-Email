Dear Dr. Fauci,

| hope all is well. BioCentury is doing a roundup of companies and institutions developing antibodies
against the SARS-CoV-2 virus to treat patients with COVID-19. Since you told my colleague Steve Usdin
NIAID is developing its own mAbs against the virus, we'd like to include information about that program

in our roundup.

Would you or one of your colleagues be able to answer the following questions? Any information you
could share by 5 PM Pacific Time on Thursday, Feb. 20 would be greatly appreciated.

1. Are your mAb candidates being developed against specific targets on SARS-CoV-2? If so, what
are those targets?

2. What platforms or processes are you using to identify mAb candidates?

3. Do you have multiple mAb programs against SARS-CoV-2 proceeding in parallel, and if so, how
are they distinguished?
