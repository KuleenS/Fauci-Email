Subject: COVID-19 multidisciplinary FAQ article

Dear Prof. Fauci,

May I briefly introduce myself: My name is Andreas Kronbichler, I am nephrologist
based in Austria, and do have an interest in renal autoimmune disease. As such, I
know your landmark study about cyclophosphamide use in GPA published in 1971;
and I have learned that you were involved in the management of David Fajgenbaum
MCD, whose story is so impressive.

I am contacting you and asking you for your help regarding a multidisciplinary FAQ
article we would like to write and which does make sense in our eyes, given the
rapid spread of this devastating infectious disease.

We would like to invite experts in the field to comment on a selected topic and then
summarize this as a paper with hopefully high impact in the field.

If you agree, can you answer this question (around 400 words max.):

Can you describe the pathophysiology and some of the immunological aspects of
SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease?

I would be personally very honored to work together with you. A selection of topics
is attached to this e-mail.

With best regards,

Andreas Kronbichler M.D. Ph.D.
