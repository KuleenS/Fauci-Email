This is something we would do in our studio at our office near Dupont Circle. We normally
do them for 45-60 minutes, and we take questions (visa Twitter) from our audience. The
audience would be reporters who cover the topic, as well as others interested in the topic.
It is a way to have an in-depth, thoughtful conversation about a pressing topic.

Here are a couple we've done (the first is on Zika a few years ago):

Zika panel discussion: https://nationalpress.org/topic/understanding-the-zika-

threat/?st=0&t=&mm=Video
Ted Koppel: https:

grid/?st=7042&mm=Video

Autonomous vehicles panel discussion: https://nationalpress.org/topic/whats-new-with-

autonomous-vehicles/?st=8474&t=Automation&mm=Story

 

We’d like to do one of these on coronavirus. We'd love to have Dr. Fauci as our prime
guest.

We can schedule it around his demands, but would of course love to do it as soon as
possible.

We know he is in demand at this moment. But he is such a singular expert on the topic
we'd love to have a discussion with him — one that would help get his message out to
journalists (and others) who need to be informed to best cover the topic.

Is it possible to check with Dr. Fauci to see if this is possible?

Thanks,
