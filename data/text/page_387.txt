Hi Jason,

Hope you have/had safe travels to DC this week! | wanted to check in to
confirm that you're still planning on coming to visit us at NIH this Friday?

Currently, Dr. Myles is holding 10am and Dr. Belkaid is holding 1:30pm to
discuss their microbiome-related research with you. Dr. Fauci’s schedule
has been very fluid lately due to the coronavirus outbreak—we'll likely need
to check in with his assistant Patty Conrad on Thursday to see how his
Friday calendar looks (unless you hear otherwise from Patty directly).

Best,
Hillary

Sounds good — I'll ask Dr. Myles to hold 10am, so you can chat
with him before you meet Dr. Fauci at 11. We can re-confirm
timing closer to the date. I'll tag along, and can make sure you
get where you need to — you'll get to visit several different
buildings, fortunately all close by!
