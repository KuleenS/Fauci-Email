They asked about the feasibility of this request. They also inquired about perhaps Dr. Fauci and
the SG doing a pre-recorded video thanking public servants for their work.

| wanted to gather the troops so we can identify what all is being planned for this week of
recognition and provide a POC for OHR if the request is feasible.

Happy to set up a call, if that is needed to discuss further.
Thanks,

Janell
