The longer a virus circulates in a human populations, the more time it has to develop mutations that
differentiate strains in infected people, and given that the 2019-nCoV sequences analyzed to date differ
from each other by seven nucleotides at most, this suggests it jumped into humans very recently. But it
remains a mystery which animal spread the virus to humans. “There’s a very large gray area between
viruses detected in bats and the virus now isolated in humans,” says Vincent Munster, a virologist at the
U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who studies coronaviruses in bats, camels, and
others species.

Strong evidence suggests the marketplace played an early role in spreading 2019-nCoV, but whether it
was the origin of the outbreak remains uncertain. Many of the initially confirmed 2019-nCoV cases—27
of the first 41 in one report, 26 of 47 in another—were connected to the Wuhan market, but up to 45%,
including the earliest handful, were not. This raises the possibility that the initial jump into people
happened elsewhere.
