Dear Tony,

You're doing a great job under terrible circumstances so [ hope you hang in there. I’m
sure the President is driving you nuts at times.

I know you're probably far too busy to do yet another program with me
(HarberTV.com/Fauci) but, if you can send mea couple of quick answers this
morning, that would be great.

1. Do you think it’s realistic we could have an effective vaccine for the COVID-19
virus by this Fall? My guess is it will be more like the Fall of 2021 but tell me if
I might be wrong.

2. Given that we’ve known about the probability of a pandemic, why are we so
poorly prepared to address it (e.g., masks, testing kits, medical staffing et
cetera)? I realize most of the needs rarely occur and when they do, there are
extraordinary spikes in demand for certain products and expertise but one
would think there are ways to address this far better than we have.

3. Is there anything people should know that is not being emphasized?

Thanks for any response you can send, even if it’s a few words. And keep up the good
work. You are greatly appreciated.

Best wishes,
Aaron
