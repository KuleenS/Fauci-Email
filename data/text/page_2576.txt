Australian cruise passengers arrive
to Darwin after Diamond Princess
virus outbreak ordeal

Feb 20

A rescue mission of Australian cruise ship passengers from Japan has
officially landed in Darwin, but the flight wasn’t free from drama.

Thousands of people sharing toilets, pools and buffets — 1s this the petri
dish of the sea?

The Qantas coronavirus rescue flight, carrying about 180 citizens and
permanent residents on board from Japan, has landed in Australia.

Qantas flight 6032 touched down in Darwin at 8.1 1am local time, after
being slightly delayed from takeoff our of Haneda.

The last-minute drama hit the rescue mission when 10 Australians, who
were set to leave the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess ship and head to
the airport, were told they had tested positive to coronavirus and had to
stay behind.

About 180 citizens and permanent residents, who have spent the past
fortnight on the quarantined cruise ship off the coast of Japan, had taken

up the Federal Government’s offer ofa seat on the repatriation flight to
Australia.

 

They join another 36 Australians who contracted coronavirus on the
Diamond Princess and are being treated in Japan. About 15 of their
relatives declined the offer of repatriation to stay with them.

The Australians on board will be screened for coronavirus five times
before they are taken to a quarantine facility at Howard

Qantas boss Alan Joyce praised the crew who took part in the
repatriation flight as well as two previous Qantas chartered flights that

brought Australians home from virus epicentre Wuhan.

“It took literally thousands of hours to plan complex operations like
these,” Mr Joyce said at t press conference today.

“The crew were all volunteers and they did us proud.”
