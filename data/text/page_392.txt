to offer in terms of
subject matter
experts and
storylines in those
areas.

Might you be
available for a short
call next week
between 4-5pm
EST on either
Tues., Wed., or
Thurs. afternoon —
corresponding to 8-
9am Melbourne
time on Wed.,
Thurs., or Fri.
morning (assuming
I've got my time
zones correct)? If
we can't find a
mutually convenient
time, happy to
continue
discussions over
email.

Best,
Hillary
