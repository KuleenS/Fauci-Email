To add to the debt...Josh and | wanted to see if you would be willing to join a call with Business
Roundtable CEOs. We have been doing COVID-19 calls with them every Friday at 1:30pm. Typically,
about 100-125 CEOS of large, U.S.-based firms will join. They are all managing and planning for difficult
issues around employee and customer safety. They would love to hear from you directly and to ask a
few questions. It might also be a good place to deliver any messages you want them to hear.

We completely understand if it isn’t doable, of course. If you are able, we would love to host you
sometime between 1:30pm-2:30pm this Friday (or any Friday on which your schedule would allow it).

Best,

Kristen
