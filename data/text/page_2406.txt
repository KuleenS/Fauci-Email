Dear Dr. Fauci:

Im a first responder, and I believe an oral vaccine platform is the best
delivery method for situations of national emergency like the
coronavirus.

If the vaccine is a tablet, we would be able to keep them on our
ambulances and get medical authorization whenever the situation arises.
First responders can then treat patients before doctors and nurses and
also instead of having the patient make an appointment Or having them
wait in line for a shot, which can ultimately cause more spread.

This method that will enable the EMS teams of the nation to combat
outbreaks because you would allow EMT (Emergency Medical
Technicians) and Paramedics to diffuse situations through our
Ambulances. This will lead to more control and get a hold of the
situations as fast as possible and lower the spread of the virus on our
people.

Thank you.
