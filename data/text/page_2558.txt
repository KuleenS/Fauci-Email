Following the confirmation, the Navy has checked the temperature of
all personnel at the base where the infected sailor served and
quarantined all those who had contacts with the person, it said.

"We have carried out disinfection work at the base and are devoting all
our efforts to preventing the spread of the new virus," the Navy said in a
release.

An officer each from the Army and the Air Force were also confirmed
to have the virus the same day.

The military is now working to identify personnel who have visited the
southeastern city of Daegu and the surrounding North Gycongsang
Province since Feb. 10, as these areas have recently seen a surge in the
number of infected people.

More than 5,000 service personnel are estimated to have visited the
region during their vacation according to the military's preliminary
investigation.

On Thursday night, the defense ministry said all personnel will be
barred from vacationing, staying outside their bases and meeting
visitors starting Saturday.

The decision was made at a meeting of top defense officials presided
over by Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo, during which he called
for "extraordinary measures" to contain the spread of the virus.

Amid growing fears over the disease, the government called off a
planned ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of a pro-democracy
movement in Daegu, which was designated a "special care zone” over
the virus earlier in the day.
