A voice from the past. Covid-19 prevented us from meeting up but I’m writing

because it might yet bring at least the two of us together.

 

--4 Samsung’s venture capital group and his team has what | think is an incredibly useful idea
for contact tracing for covid-19 as well as actually opening the economy up again. The idea is contained
within the attachment.

| wonder if you still have any contacts with Anthony Fauci. Is so, could you see your way clear to
forwarding the attachment to him? The group has identified some appropriate test manufacturers but
is at the point where they need to know the spectrum so as to focus on the optimal ones. The thought
was that Tony Fauci might be the best person to know what tests are in development stage.

What are your thoughts?

Don’t worry about confidentiality; they want to widely share this idea so as to get it out as quickly as
possible.

Thanks
