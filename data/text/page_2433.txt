Subject: a question

Dr. Fauci,

May | suggest a question that you might ask of COVID-19 identified patients? Could you
ask them if they had received a current flu shot for this season? Since the COVID-19
corona virus basic construct is a basic flu version with a bio-engineered HIV or other(’?)
component, is it possible that our flu vaccines might have some degree of protection
against this new COVID-19 viral construct? | think it is important to ask this question!
Dr. Len Trudell
