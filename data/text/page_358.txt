Subject: cdc coronavirus

The CDC today alerted Americans to begin to prepare for community spread of the
coronavirus.....does this changes Dr. Fauci’s view on the virus? If so can he join us. If this
doesn’t change anything. We can use what he said this morning....or if he wants to come
on and talk about the new CDC wanrning...we would like to speak to him.
