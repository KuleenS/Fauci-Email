essays available through Amazon's expedited publishing platform
roughly one month after that. Each essay should be no more than 1,000
words, and I may offer light edits for the author's final approval. A
final note: all proceeds from the sale of the book will be donated.

I am very hopeful that you will give every serious consideration to
this invitation, and will lend your voice towards reimagining and
revitalizing a new America.

Best,
Dave
