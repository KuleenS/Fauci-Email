-Airway epithelium (including alveolar epithelial cells);
-Alveolar macrophages;

MB Is an inexpensive medication.
MB is non-toxic molecule in humans

There are only a few cases of MB toxicity published in the literature. These cases
occurred in very peculiar situations:

Hemolytic anemia in patients with G6-PD deficiency

Severe neuropathology after intrathecal administration of MB
Eye injury after topical use of MB

Tissue necrosis due to the extravasation of injected MB
Jejunal atresia following intra-amniotic MB

Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI’s) interact with MB, causing a serious adverse
reaction consistent with serotonin syndrome.
