If they accept two people, you should go with Gray. Obviously, you should make
no commitments and when asked about policy issues, say that you will convey to
me and we will get back to them.

Have you had a chance to discuss this world bank conference? You, Cliff and Libby received invites. As
Gray has mentioned, this is a pledging conference, so we will need to be prepared to address funding
(the person that attends would need to be in sync with you on that).

Obviously Cliff is on travel. Who would you like to have at the conference, if anyone?
