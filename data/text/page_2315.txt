Subject: Science of COVID-19 Curriculum?

Dr. Fauci,

Twenty years ago, I wrote the US curriculum "The Science of HIV" and we were honored to
have you featured in our accompanying television broadcast, which was nominated for an Emmy
(Discovery Channel). Years prior to that, | snagged my Masters from BU on some novel,
emergent retrovirus called HIV.

Now, its time for me to do my magic and educate this new generation on COVID-19. This is a
familiar audience (my people), since most use the science programs I have authored for K-8 for
the past 30 years!

How do I best proceed with developing materials in sync with the national needs that demystify
the concepts surrounding COVID-19 ? My skillset is in education, but my background in biology
and biochem.

Please Google me and/or check out the links below.
