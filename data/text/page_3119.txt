Hi, Tony, | just returned from an overseas trip but should be around tomorrow and can certainly clear
some time to meet with Mark. | met Mark at the NAM meeting last year and would love to hear what
they have to say. Let me know what works. Good luck in dealing with the new coronavirus pandemic
(not sure whether it is qualified as one yet; if not, pretty close)!! Jake

Jake:

Sorry for this last minute ask, but(@____——_—_— 3}, Ambassador Mark Dybul, who is the
former Head of PEPFAR and the former Director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and
Malaria will be at the NIH tomorrow with a scientist who has some very interesting data on
hepatitis B. | was supposed to meet with them, but | am swamped with the coronavirus. Is
there any chance that you can meet with them briefly tomorrow. | believe that you might be
interested in seeing them. Ihave copied Mark on this e-mail and so! will ask him to e-mail you
to see if you can make this happen. Many thanks.

Best regards,
Tony
