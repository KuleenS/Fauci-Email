Hi Dr. Fauci,
Hope all is well.

Dr. Fauci, we will be setting up COVID-19 testing facilities and | wanted to ask your opinion
regarding the following:

Is it ok to expand our testing beyond the current strict testing criteria to include those with
lesser symptoms or potential exposure whom we want to rule out Covid-19?

We are concerned that while we isolate those with more severe symptoms who currently
qualify for testing, the majority with lesser symptoms would be ambulatory and potentially
spreading the illness to others. Plus, it is hard to get someone to isolate for 14 days without
providing a diagnosis.

Just as we can test those we suspect for Influenza A, Influenza B and RSV, it would be helpful to
be able to test those we suspect with Covid-19, including healthcare workers with no symptoms
but with possible exposure.

Thank you for your time and your leadership for our nation's healthcare.

Be well.

Rob
