Francis:

Derek Kan, Acting Deputy Director of OMB and a member of the President’s
Coronavirus Task Force called me last night and in a very nice way said he would
like to send me a list of names for consideration to be on the working groups to
examine the evolution of the nCoV. He worked as an executive in biotech prior
to joining the USG and knows these individuals well. They are all people that we
know and sol am just passing them on to you for our consideration.

 

Thanks,
Tony
