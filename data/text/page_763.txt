Dear Dr. Fauci,

| hope to find you well with this email.

| take the liberty to write you because | have some concern about the misinformation

that can discredit your task and honors.

On many occasions in tv and press, Antonio Giordano, Director of Sbarro Institute in Philadelphia,
Keeps saying that he is a member of the USA Task Force.

I’m wondering if it’s true.

| work in UK, but I’m originally from Naples (Italy).
| held my PhD in Carlo Croce’s lab at OSU and I specialized in immunotherapy at University of Chicago.
Currently I’m a research fellow at University of Sussex.

| apologize if you find this email inopportune, the time is unfortunate, | grant you.
| don’t like the idea that some people might take advantage of this very unpleasant moment for all the world.
So | wish that | made a mistake this time.

I’m also wondering if you are willing to release a brief interview.
| stand with you and USA that | miss very much

| really appreciate your time
Thank you
Kind Regards
