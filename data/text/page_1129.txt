Fordham, the private Jesuit university in The Bronx that launched the legendary Vin Scully, for
decades has been a powerhouse sportscasting pipeline, especially in New York. And the school
ties that first united Breen and Kay are webbed throughout the industry.

Fordham is the alma mater for the voice of the NBA Finals/Knicks (Breen, Class of 1983), the
Yankees’ lead TV play-by-player/ESPN New York afternoon radio host (Kay, ’82), the voice of
the Giants (Bob Papa, ’86), the radio voice of the Nets (Chris Carrino, 92) MSG’s John
Giannone (’86), YES’ Jack Curry (’86), WFAN’s Paul Dottino (’86) and YES/ESPN’s Ryan
Ruocco (’08). And that’s just New York-based sportscasters.

For good measure, the school produced CBS’ Spero Dedes (’01), ESPN’s Tony Reali (00) and
the Washington Nationals’ Charlie Slowes (’83). There are many more, and not just in front of
the camera. If you need a field producer, Jim Johnson (’86) works for ESPN. A radio engineer?
WFAN’s Chris Majkowski (’89) will set things up. Media relations? Louis Barricelli (09) 1s
leading things at MLB Network.

Like everyone else, they are all dealing with the halt of sports due to the coronavirus pandemic.
It is a jarring timeout for people so used to being on the run.
