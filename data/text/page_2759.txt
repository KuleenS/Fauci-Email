the Ritz Carlton (22nd and M St. NW), Washington, D.C.
Patty,
| wanted to check back with you and Dr. Fauci on a few things in advance of his fireside

chat with David Rubenstein on Friday, February 21.

e Are there any articles that Dr. Fauci thinks would be useful to send out to our CEOs
in advance of the discussion (it may be something related to the Coronavirus or
something that looks at the future of health and what CEOs should be thinking
about in the next decade?
