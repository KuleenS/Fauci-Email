Subject: Thanks and ideas
Tony:

| wanted to send a note of thanks for your leadership and everything you're doing to make our country's
response to this outbreak as effective as possible. | also wanted to share a few ideas of ways we could
help you get your message out, but | understand you're incredibly busy, so don't feel a need to reply
unless these seem interesting.

This isn't public yet, but we're building a Coronavirus Information Hub that we're going to put at the top
of Facebook for everyone (200+ million Americans, 2.5 billion people worldwide) with two goals: (1)
make sure people can get authoritative information from reliable sources and (2) encourage people to
practice social distance and give people ideas for doing this using internet tools. This will be live within
the next 48 hours.

As a central part of this hub, | think it would be useful to include a video from you because people trust
and want to hear from experts rather than just a bunch of agencies and political leaders. This could be
done in a number of formats if you're open to it. Probably best would be recording a Q&A where you
answer people's top questions, but we'd be open to other formats too.

I'm also doing a series of livestreamed Q&As with health experts to try to use my large following on the
platform (100 million followers) to get authoritative information out as well. I'd love to have you do one
