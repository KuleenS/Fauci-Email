This is Melanie Starling writing on behalf of PBS’S FIRING LINE WITH MARGARET HOOVER.

FIRING LINE is the rare program in the political landscape that seeks a rigorous and earnest
exchange of ideas, with the luxury to let the conversation breathe. Margaret has brought back
the spirit of this venerated show, which aired from 1966 to 1999, that is lacking in today’s
polarized cable news ecosystem — at a time when we need it more than ever. One guest. 30
minutes. Airing to a thoughtful and engaged PBS audience.

We would be honored to have Dr. Anthony S. Fauci join Firing Line for an
interview.

Dr. Fauci has dedicated his career to understanding, preventing, and protecting people across
the globe from infectious diseases, which is why we would be so honored to share our stage
with him at this time. As the coronavirus continues to spread, we are interested in better
understanding the deadly virus the world is racing to contain. Equally, we are interested in
highlighting any other public health issues or policies close to Dr. Fauci’s heart. Most
importantly, with our program, we have the luxury of time — where we can truly delve into
these issues in a substantive, nuanced manner that is missing in much of today’s 24-hour news
cycle.
