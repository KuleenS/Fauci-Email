Dear Dr. Kaldec,

| have not heard from you in over a week. You mentioned getting back to meina
day or two. Time is passing. | am asking you to look at OPV 1 plus 3 serotypes as a
bivalent, completely safe vaccine with powerful stimulation of innate immunity
lasting several weeks , which can be given a second or third time, and witha
historical track record of preventing other infections from entirely different RNA
viruses (such as protecting against influenza). Therefore, it should be really helpful
for some months, and | think get us past a second wave of SARS-CoV-2, and help
people return to work safely. | don’t understand delays or apparent lack of interest.
Who can possibly be against this? If you hear of hypothetical problems we can
show you that these are false. Just ask the questions, and we can give you the
evidence.

However, no answer from you suggests no interest and must quickly make
alternative pathways. | am though quite surprised and fear you are receiving “fake
news” if you will pardon the expression. Some have been against this who defend
their old and failed position on polio eradication with their promotion of the use of
the inactivated polio virus vaccine. Please note that in the US between 1962 and
1985 we received (safely) the oral polio (OPV). Moreover, if vaccinated already
there has not been a single case of a complication and BILLIONS have received it.
No it will not last long as innate immunity is short lived, but we strongly believe
that we can break the back of the SARS-CoVID-2 spread. Also note that this is what
Bill Gates is doing now in India and much of the Eastern hemisphere.

There are countries outside the US wanting to move fast on this. We are waiting for
your reply.
