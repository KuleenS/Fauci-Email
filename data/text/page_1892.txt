Andrew Cuomo is also doing a great job informing all of NY (and the rest of us)
about what’s going on, and his expectations for the public.

Whatever they’re paying you _...it’s not enough.

You keep your powder dry, and extra flints in your pocket!

Good morning, Paul.

Hope you guys at OHA are holding up OK.

I'm fine, family is fine. [© @ is dong lots of telemedicine and seeing actual PEDS
patients at Westside Hosp. now a few days a week.
My clinic is still open but pretty quiet... we need to stay open at some level no matter what.

One of my colleagues from the NIH (Dr. David Brandon ...he actually published with Tony Fauci
back in the late ‘70s | believe !)..sent me this email on Saturday morning

| suspect you all know about pooled sampling,.....David did it at the NIH for a study that | have
long forgotten about. ...thought I’d pass it along to you......

“| just looked up to see if pooled sampling has been used to detect viruses in the past, and
found that it has been used in a number of cases including during the HIV scare. | am including
a link thttps:
testing/ to an article in the lay press reporting on an RT-PCR based test that uses swabs from
30-60 individuals to determine if the pooled sample has Covid-19. The study was successful
and they are developing it to test workers in the front line work places such as hospitals. There
is a body of literature using this method for other mass screenings.”

 

Then | heard that CEPHEID will be getting their Genexpert instrument validated to measure
COVID-19. Turns out we have one in my Lab, use it for Chlamydia & Gonorrhea (we have lots
of patients here needing this testing). But as you so well know, having the instrumentation
without the collection swabs/M4 media, etc. Is a bit like biking up a blind alley. | would hope
we'll hear more about this.
