Subject: How to put COVID-19 statistics in perspective

Today (March 3), CNN featured a discussion with NY Gov. Cuomo regarding a new COVID-19 case in NY
City. He happened to note that there are currently about 15,000 patients in NY hospitals with the flu.
Although multiple government agencies, scientists and health experts keep reminding us that there are
far more cases, hospitalizations and deaths each year from influenza than this coronavirus, it strikes me
that a more effective, more visual and less fear-producing way of presenting this information would be
to present the current number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths from EACH of these diseases side by
side. If the number of flu cases, hospitalizations and/or deaths isn’t available on a daily basis, we could
use extrapolations based on known rates. | think this would certainly go a long way to putting the
relative risks of these diseases in clearer focus.
