Dear Dr. Fauci,

| hope you are doing well. Your participation during our Washington DC 2017 convention was one of the
most memorable events of our organization’s history.

United States and the world now turns to you for your help as Coronavirus crisis is becoming pandemic.
All of us here at KAMA are thinking about you and all those affected. Thank you very much for all your
contributions.

Warm regards,

John Won
