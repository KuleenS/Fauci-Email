Cortona virus is a spiked virus and the spikes are used by the virus to first attach
“to’dhd then invade into the host cells. Subsequently the genetic materials, RNA
ate’ injected where it hijacks the host replication machinery to multiple and re-
infect more cells. If the initial attachment or the fusion of the virus and host
membranes can be blocked, the virus replication cycle can be stopped, bringing
the infection under control. The spike protein consists of two components, a
globular head, S1 that helps the initial attachment and a spiral part S2 that is

responsible for membrane fusion which forms the channel for the entry of the
