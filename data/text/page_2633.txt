latest re the cruise ship outbreak
below (two stories). We can glean
from these stories that the number
infected 1s now up to 454. And 14
positive passengers were included
among the Americans who were
evacuated to the US. Canada,
South Korea, Italy and Hong Kong
announced Sunday that they
would also arrange charter flights
to evacuate their citizens. A few
additional pieces of data. News
reports yesterday stated that 73 of
the 355 confirmed cases from the
cruise ship were asymptomatic
(20%). Also, yesterday the media
quoted Dr. Fauci that the total
number of Americans who were
confirmed to have COVID
yesterday and who remained at
hospitals in Japan at 44.

Assuming that this number does
not include the 14 confirmed cases
that were evacuated, suggests that
the total number of Americans
with confirmed COVID is 58. An
earlier news report from Feb-12 re
a couple from California, noted
the husband was in the ICU in
Japan (so at least | American in
the ICU). [“...remained in a
hospital intensive care unit and
has been able to communicate
with his family, his wife said in a
phone interview from the ship,
where she remained in
quarantine.”
