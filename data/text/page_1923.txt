clinical parameters to justify ending precautions, rather than requiring microbiological tests. A
Get Out of Isolation Free card, if you will. The hypothesis we are testing to 2 weeks after onset
and >72 hours without symptoms. Currently the published recommendations are not

Finally, in all complex epidemics, there is a tendency to search for a silver bullet—that one thing
that will solve all of our problems. When an intervention is in short supply, the bullet turns
platinum— “if only we could do x, the problem would be solved”. This was vaccine in 2009
H1N1, naloxone in the opioid crisis, and now testing in coronavirus. Increased access to testing
is desperately needed to control the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is going to take a
scientifically and wholistic and systemic approach to mitigate the impact. You have nicely
outlined some of the “next questions” that are raised when testing is more widely available.

More to follow.

Some very complicated questions around testing have come up and will only increase.

No symptoms — get test positive — can you work

Symptoms — test negative — can you work — or do you need 2 negatives — or the test has to be done 2-3-
4 days after you develop symptoms

Test positive — back to work when — do you need negative tests — or just time - ? 2 weeks after first
symptoms, first test positive.

As tests become more widely available this will be devil folks.
