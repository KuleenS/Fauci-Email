Subject: Potential Coronavirus Prophylaxis

Dear Dr. Fauci,

You likely do not recall meeting me when | was looking at potential
fellowships in 1978, however, | never forgot your enthusiasm. | went
out to San Diego and worked with Mike Oldstone between 1979 and 11984.
| did study a mouse coronavirus while there, mouse hepatitis virus
(MHV). | focused on genetic resistance, and eventually described a
mouse locus for susceptibility, which coded for the MHV receptor. On
to the present problem of human coronaviruses. Vaccines will take a
long time for the current crisis. The angiotensin convertin enzyme 2
receptor has been identifed as the relevant human coronavirus
receptor. | am writing to suggest the investigation of ARBs as
potential blocking agents to either reduce or completely block
infection. Perhaps this can be checked. There may still be sufficient
untainted supplies of ARBs, such as irbesartan, available, or
production can be scaled up, if this truly is the eve of a pandemic.
Wishing you success in this endeavor. | am willing to contribute in
any way | can. Please feel free to contact me by e-mail or my cell
phone.

| did do clinical trial while with Mike, and then when | joined the
