Dear D. Fauci,

| want to suggest that NIAID arrange to collect serum samples from Coronavirus patients who
have survived a major infection and probably have generated antiviral antibodies. My
laboratory showed in the attached papers that such antibodies could be cloned from sera using
a powerful technology called Phage Display. The project could be initiated in this country with
as few as 2 patients.

Sincerely, Alan Garen, Yale University
