Singapore. But unlike Singapore, Japan has been slow to implement
NPIs. The other concern is that Japan’s population is
disproportionately aged (it has the highest % age 65 of any country). In
Japan, 27% of the population is > 65; in the US, 15.6% of the
population is > 65. And Japan can also claim the largest city in the
world (metro Tokyo with 38 M people—pretty much the population of
California crammed into an area smaller than the size of Connecticut).

Japan also has the 10 largest city in the world (Osaka with 19 M
people).

What has me worried 1s what happened on the cruise ship is a preview
of what will happen when this virus makes its way to the US healthcare
system (not to mention institutionalized high-risk populations in the
