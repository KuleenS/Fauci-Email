Dr Fauci,

| know that Dr Kaclec has mentioned the news we heard from
genentech about the evaluation of monoclonal antibodies to IL-6 and
IL-6R in severely ill COVID-19 patients in China.

Additional information became available yesterday and we learned
that China updated Their clinical guidelines to include anti-iL6.

 

| welcome your thoughts and would also make our team available for a
quick call if you prefer.

Many thanks. | know you are very busy.

Rick
