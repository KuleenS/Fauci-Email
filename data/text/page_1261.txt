| want to share with you the product of the BCG team who drafted the attached briefing and
Decision Memo drafted for the Secretary's review tomorrow. | want to thank all those who
contributed over this holiday weekend to offer their ideas and concepts that is represented in
these products. This represents just a first step of many steps that first outlines a concept that
will then be operationalized into a historic effort for not only the Department and agencies who
will contribute to it, but to our Nation. Again, thank you for your contributions and
commitment. Best Bob
