Thanks, Jeremy. | saw the report in the Post from Saturday. These children had
mostly respiratory disease and diarrhea. | will check with the docs at DC
Children’s Hospital about the presence of “multisystem inflammatory state”. This
could just be the advanced stage of their disease compatible with advanced
SARS-COV-2

Best,

Tony
