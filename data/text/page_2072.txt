Dear Dr. Fauci,

| am a postdoc researcher working at LSU health sciences center In New Orleans. | would like to
communicate my concern about the COVID19 in the US.

| am Italian and my partner is Chinese and we have been carefully following the COVID19
spread first in China and now in Italy and Europe. Based on my scientific and personal
knowledge | am confident to say that the US is only few weeks ahead of What is happening in
Italy now and this could only be stopped if strict measures will be taken in the entire country as
soon as possible.

If you have the power, | ask you to please try to convince the government to apply such
measures, even if this means to shut down the entire country for some weeks. | know that the
economy and money interests are what often prevents to take such decision, but in this case
we are talking about life and death and we cannot risk this high price.

We have a very clear example of how severe the COVID19 can be if we do not act on time and
this is unfortunately my country at this time. We also have a good example, China, in which
very aggressive measures have been applied and, despite some delay in their application at
first, they now have reached a strong regression in the virus spread and they gradually can
restart the country. China measures were to close every city borders, close working places and
every non essential activity. They asked the population to stay at home and go out only for food
and health emergencies. | think this is what we should do in US too.

A recent study from Italy in which they tested every person in one Italian city showed that the
50-70% of the people positive for the virus were asymptomatic. This is such an important
information that tells us the only way to prevent the spread is to prevent the people from
moving because we cannot really know who is caring the virus. Also, screening is important and

should be ideally extended to everyone. https://www.repubblica.it/salute/medicina-e-
