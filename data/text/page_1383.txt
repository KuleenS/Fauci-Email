Tony,

Obviously, you have a few other issues on your daily agenda but, when you have a minute, we would
appreciate your thoughts and guidance on three new Bob Langer biotech developments. We have
attached three links to recent MIT News articles. These three innovations at the Langer Lab were
originally funded by the Gates Foundation. We thought the last two breakthroughs, in particular, may be
applicable to your current work. Thank you again for your continued guidance.

Best wishes,

Wayne Reynolds
