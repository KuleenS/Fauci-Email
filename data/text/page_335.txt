Subject: Guidance for users of biologics in the age of Coronavirus.

Dear Nehal,

With the coronavirus bordering on a pandemic and the expectation that it will affect the US at some
point, it seems to me we should be prepared to provide guidance to patients who are on immune
modulators for inflammatory disease. Specifically, many will wonder if patients should stop their
biologic if the virus becomes prevalent in their community. There will also be questions about stopping
biologics in the setting of acute infection with coronavirus.

Any thoughts on this? My specific interests relates to patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis on
biologics but it’s also relevant to patients with IBD, RA and other inflammatory diseases.

Joel
