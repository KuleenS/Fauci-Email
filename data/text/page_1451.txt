| am sure your days are full not only of the complex logistics and tension that fill leadership roles at
this time but also maintaining a “steady hand on the rudder” as we navigate these challenging
waters. | think back to my days at New York Presbyterian and Cornell Med, Knowing that we are
both Cornell Med grads, both did our residency and fellowship training in New York, and have had
the opportunity to interact back so many years ago. | do remember quite well the first time that we
met and have always reflected warmly at having even a brief opportunity to interact.

| do not write to ask for anything but to just simply thank you for all that you continue to do and know
that you always have a friend here in Nebraska. | wish you and your family the very best as we
continue this journey.

Most sincerely,

   

Jeffrey P. Gold, M.D.
