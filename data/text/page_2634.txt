So, piecing all the data together:

The ~400 Americans account for
11% of the 3,711 passengers and
crew of the Diamond Princess.

The 58 confirmed cases among
Americans account for 12% of the
454 total confirmed COVID cases

Assuming that proportion of
asymptomatic cases in Americans
is similar to the proportion of
asymptomatic cases for the entire
ship (73/355 or 20%), we would
estimate the number of Americans
with asymptomatic infection at
~12. Symptomatics would be 46.
If 2% of cases result in ICU
admission (based on earlier
estimates on Feb-12 where 4 ICU
cases were reported with 203 total
confirmed cases), we would
expect ~9 ICU cases overall with
454 infected. Media reports from
today note 19 of the passengers
are “seriously 111, with some of
whom treated in intensive care
units.” (Would be helpful to
quantify “some”—from the earlier
data, we would estimate about half
that number would require ICU
care at some point). For the 54
Americans confirmed to have
COVID, we would estimate 1
would require ICU care if 2% of
cases required ICU care (we are
already aware of at least |
American who was receiving ICU
care in Japan).
