Subject: HIGH SCHOOL MUN ON

Dear Dr. Anthony Fauci,

My name is Dane Cohn, and | am an ) ©}. | have often
listened to your inspiring words on the news and followed your assiduous work to help
us through this pandemic. Our school participates in Model UN, an event in which high
school students represent various countries in debates on international issues from the
past and present. Colorado's final Model UN conference was canceled, so our school
)(©}) decided to host an online conference for the whole state
of Colorado and beyond. Our team would like to formally invite you to give a short
address (be it pre-recorded or live online) to the students during our opening
ceremony.

 

 

We hope that our conference will inspire the youth of our nation and the world to stand
up and fight for our future rather than resign their aspirations to lockdown. We host this
conference because we see the importance of keeping our academic passions going
while staying safe within the confines of our homes. We host this conference because
we want to contribute to the fight against COVID-19 — money raised from our
conference will go towards buying masks, food, and other resources for those who need
it most.

This is why we ask you, a hero during this troubling time, to speak to the students of our
conference, who not only include the youth of Colorado, but also the youth of our
country and world. Any type of address would be greatly and wholeheartedly
appreciated. If your address is pre-recorded, we would appreciate it if we could receive
it by May 1st, as our conference is the morning of May 2nd. We believe you can bring
true inspiration into our hearts and minds. We know you are very busy, but if it were at
all possible to share with us even a short 2-3 minute pre-recorded greeting and
message to the students participating in this Model UN conference, it would be truly
inspirational. Thank you so much for your time, we hope to hear from you soon.

Most Respectfully,

Dane Cohn and the entiref—______—*®) © Model UN Team
