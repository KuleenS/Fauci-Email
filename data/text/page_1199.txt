Those events were so many years ago,[ (©) ©] Nn? So much has happened
and changed since then, and now, seeing you and listening to your wise words and advice

every day, | am reminded that we need to reconnect, when it’s safe and you have time. We
have so much to catch up on! | have been meaning to write to you or call you, but I had
misplaced your email address and phone numbers. | hope this address works and this
message reaches you.

Meantime, thank you for your service to our country, indeed the world. You have been a solid,
wise, steady voice, Tony, and, despite all the naysayers and fools on social media, you have
earned the respect of billions of people. | am very proud of you, and am humbled and honored
that | can call you my friend.

| hope you and your family are well, and staying safe. The Broas family is doing well, thanks in
no small part to your daily advice and objective analysis. Thank you! Please let me know if

there is anything | can do for you or your family.

Looking forward to seeing you on the other side of this, and having a good catch up. Who
knows, maybe at a Nats game?

Best regards,
Tim
