Is there any evidence to suggest that patients already on treatment with angiotensin
receptor blockers have a better or worse COVID-19 outcome than patients not on
these medications? Similar question for initiating ARB treatment once COVID-19
has been diagnosed. And similar questions for ACE inhibitors. Thank you.
