In a reversal of long-standing policy, WHO now recommends that all countries
implement temperature screening at points of entry for passengers arriving from 2019-
nCoV—affected countries. Screening should be accompanied by dissemination of risk-
communication messages at points of entry to later capture asymptomatic persons who
are in the incubation phase.

In early January, some exit screening was implemented at Wuhan Tianhe International
Airport (nonstop flights to Istanbul, London, New York, Osaka, Paris, Rome, San
Francisco, Tokyo, and major hubs throughout Southeast Asia), as well as at 3 major rail
stations in Wuhan. More restrictive screening was instituted on January 15 in Hubei
until cessation of international flights on January 23. Despite exit screening at all
international airports in China in the past week, significant numbers of cases continue to
be exported.

Entry screening at international ports of entry has been or is being implemented as
noted below, and anyone with fever and respiratory symptoms who has been to 2019-
nCoV-—affected areas in the previous 14 days will be detained and isolated at these
locations:
