Subject: RE: CRO] COVID 19 Session; Tuesday March 10 lunch

Dear Dr Fauci:

As | mentioned on the phone, we just today decided that we will have a special session on COVID 19 at
CROI. It will be on Tuesday, March 10, during the lunch break; the initial general structure will be a 10-

to 15- minute overview (CDC), a 25-min talk by Ralph Barac (UNC) about the virology of coronaviruses,

and a 10- to 15-minute summary on what NIAID/NIH is doing and planning. We thought that this being
one of the first large medical conferences in infectious diseases this year, that we address COVID 19 at

CROI

We know that this is terribly last minute, but the CRO! Chairs and Foundation are hoping you are free to
give the NIAID/NIH update. CROI is in Boston, March 8 to 11.

If you think you would be able to do this, we will send a more formal communication with details and
work with Patty on the specifics. Thank you so much Dr Fauci; we hope you will be able to join us.

Best,
Donna
