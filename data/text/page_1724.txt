Wharton this coming week or next week. We would love to hear your
thoughts on dealing with the coronavirus, lessons learned from other
countries, and how we can prepare for a potential recurrence, as has
been discussed in the media, along with other topics you deem
important.

I may also be able to get students from Oxford University to join, as I
attended there as well, and I know the UK is dealing with its own set of
challenges.

I look forward to hearing from you, and can be reached at
Ej or via email (arash@arash.tv).

God bless you, and thank you for everything you have been doing.

Best Regards,
Arash
