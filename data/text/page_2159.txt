>5. Encourage online shopping and drive-thru pick-up including groceries. Help the local businesses to expand
their delivering capacities.

>

>6. Provide the public live updates on the outbreak, including the number of confirmed cases, their current
clinical status, strategies of tracing their close contacts, as well as the number of total cases being tested. From what
I have learned, the more transparent the government is, the less panic the public will be.

>7. Issue laws that prohibit intentional spread of COVID-19, irresponsible behaviors that put other innocent
people or medical professionals at risk of contracting the virus.

>

> Early January in Wuhan, many patients very likely contracted COVID-19 in the local hospitals when they visited
their physicians for other medical conditions. In addition, the medical system in Wuhan China was almost paralyzed
at that time. One of major reasons is that many medical professionals were infected and sick. The medical
professionals are the backbone in the fight against this virus outbreak. We need to prepare for the worst scenario that
this outbreak can last for a few or several months. We need to protect our medical professionals first.

>

> 1. Set up a centralized Fever/COVID-19 hotline operated by trained provider/nursing staff. This telephone line can
use the current available state information hotline, with expanded functions serving as a gatekeeper and triage
mechanism for potential COVID-19 patients to receive guidance on where to seek help before visiting a busy clinic,
an urgent care, or a hospital emergency room to minimize the chances of cross-infection and over-whelming large
medical centers.

>

> 2. Establish designated Fever/COVID-19 clinics or hospitals led by well-trained ID teams (MD, NP), especially in
highly populated areas. These clinics will serve as the secondary triage and referral centers for the aforementioned
Fever/COVID-19 hotline, plus for primary care clinics that are not equipped with adequate staff and testing tools.
These clinics should have adequate staff including physicians and middle level providers, equipped with testing kits
to perform COVID-19 test onsite. They should have the capacity of testing drive-through patients, securing airway
for ventilation if needed before transferring severe patients to tertiary medical facilities. They should be operated
collaboratively with larger healthcare systems like U Iowa, Unity Point, and Mercy who are setting up their own
isolated COVID-19 centers for more severe cases.

>

> 3. Establish a clear communication and transfer protocol between Fever/COVID-19 hotlines, clinics and treating
hospitals for management of suspicious and confirmed cases. For those with mild COVID-19 infection, they should
be self-quarantined at home and monitored closely and remotely. If they cannot perform self-quarantine safely, such
as living by themselves or in nursing homes, they should be kept in the county isolation facilities (as mentioned
above), being monitored there.

>

> 4. If drive-through testing is available at CVS or Walgreen, patients with positive results should call the hotline or
their PCPs first if clinically stable to receive guidance for self-quarantine, monitoring and follow-up. If they cannot
perform self-quarantine safely, they should be kept in the county isolation facilities as mentioned above.

>

> 5. Inform the public and other healthcare providers of the availability of these Fever/COVID-19 hotline and
clinics, encouraging patients with symptoms to utilize these resources first before visiting clinics, emergency rooms
to reduce the chances of cross-infection, and the burden on large medical centers.

>

> 6. Encourage medical professionals to call their clinic patients for screening. Allow the medical providers to
postpone all non-urgent medical visits for annual checkups, stable and non-urgent chronic conditions et al.

>

> 7. Encourage all physicians and healthcare professionals who provide direct patient care to wear personal
protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, eye shields and gloves to protect themselves and to minimize the
chances of spreading the virus to other patients, if necessary or based on their screening phone calls.
