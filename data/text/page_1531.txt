Subject: Article - BCG protection from COVID-19 mortality

Hello everyone,

| found this article that comes to a similar conclusion regarding the protective role of universal BCG
vaccination on COVID-19 mortality. | will be working with an epidemiologist from Virginia Tech to see if
we can provide stronger quantitative analysis and modelling.

All the best,

Carolina
