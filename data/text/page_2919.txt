In light of the current and evolving threat
presented by the corona virus, I am writing
to you as a courtesy to inform you of a
project that Admiral Jackson, Dr.
Hofmann, and I have been consulting on.
We believe so strongly in the technology,
people, and potential that we have been
consulting pro bono and currently have no
financial stake in the project. While not
developed specifically designed for such
purposes, I increasingly believe that until a
vaccination and treatment for the corona
virus is available, this technology may be
the last best chance in containing, and
eradicating the virus, thereby protecting
the homeland, our economy, the Continuity
of the Presidency, an Enduring
Constitutional Government, our people and
our Country. Moreover, reverting to my
"lessons-learned, problems-ahead"
statement, even after this crisis is over, and
a vaccine and treatment procured, it will
only be a matter of time until "next time.”
This letter is proof-positive of that reality.
My experiences, especially in the early
2000's (e.g. anthrax and other biothreats,
SARs, etc.) underpin my beliefs.

The technology that provides the solution,

both now and in the future, involves a
unique formulation of a photo catalytic
