Hey Dr. Fauci-

My name is Zach Davis, I'm the founder and editor-in-chief at The Trek, a
media company dedicated to long distance backpackers. Thank you for the
tremendous service and leadership you've given this country during a time
of great need.

I'm reaching out to inquire about the possibility of your doing a short
interview for our flagship podcast, Backpacker Radio, the #1 rated hiking
podcast on iTunes. We're putting together an episode related to how
COVID-19 has impacted this year’s class of backpackers, and would love to
feature your expert insight on why social distancing is important, and what
the future may hold for our community.

The interview would be about 20-25 minutes, though if you're only
available for a shorter period, we'll take what we can get!

Thanks for your time and thank you again for your terrific service to this
country.

Happy hiking,
Zach Davis
