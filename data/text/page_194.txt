Subject: invitation to speak on COVID 19 at the International ATS Conterence in May
Dear Dr. Fauci,

| don’t believe that we’ve formally met, but | have seen you frequently on 5SE as | admit patients there
and often participate in the ward rounds. |! aman Al on several of Steve Hollands protocols, and | often
help with the drug-resistant TB cases. | have been at the NIH now for over 4 years, although | still fee!
like the new guy on the block! Most of my career has been focused on quantifying the infectious
aerosols generated by TB patients. | am very involved in the leadership of the American Thoracic
Society (ATS) as the Past Chair of the Assembly on Pulmonary Infections and TB. | am writing to invite
you to be a keynote speaker at a special Scientific Session being added to our International Conference
May 16-20 due to the emerging pandemic of COVID-19. The exact time and data are not yet known,
but the conference is relatively close in Philadelphia. This would be an opportunity to address and
educate global academic leaders in pulmonary and critical medicine, infectious diseases, and public
health. We usually have over 15,000 attendees at the ATS meeting. | am attaching the email string
below to give you an idea of other speakers being considered.

| can only imagine how busy you must be now, so [ apologize if this invitation is a distraction or a
nuisance. And | would certainly understand if you are unable to join us given the demands on your time,
but we would be absolutely delighted if you could speak.

Please feel to call or contact me at any time with questions or comments.

Sincerely,
Kevin Fennelly
