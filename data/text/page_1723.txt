Hi Dr. Fauci,

I just wanted to confirm you received this.

I also just read a great story on you in the WSJ, which discussed your amazing
basketball and leadership skills when you were in college. Not surprisingly, even
then, your teammates were seeking your advice on leading them through difficult
times.

Talk to you soon.

Regards,
Arash

our nation during these challenging times. Your steady hand, calm
demeanor, incisive thoughts, and intellectual rigor, have all been quite
comforting to us the last few weeks.

I] would like to see if you may have a few minutes to participate in a
webcast interview with myself and classmates from Harvard and
