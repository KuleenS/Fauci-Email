Dear Dr. Fauci,

I know that you are extremely busy, but I would respectfully urge you to take 5
mins. of your time to review the information below as I believe that I have a
disruptive technology that can help prevent the spread of COVID-19.

My name is John Flynn. I previously founded a startup medical equipment company
that was focused within the area of orthopedics, which I ran for twelve years. I
ultimately sold the company to a public competitor, DJO Global. I have worked on
different healthcare projects, but have exclusively spent the last twenty months
focused on a new medical product within the area of infection prevention. My goal
was to introduce what I believe is a disruptive product to help healthcare
facilities to prevent the spread of MDRO’s in order to reduce HAI’s/SSI’s;
however, I believe that it can also help to reduce the spread of Coronavirus.
