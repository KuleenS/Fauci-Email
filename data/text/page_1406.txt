Dear Tony -

| know you are overwhelmed, but the attached whitepaper on a vaccine-development idea might be
worth a look. You may member Chad Mirkin as a member of the Obama PCAST whose extraordinary
contributions across a range of science and engineering issues have landed him in the NAS, NAE, and
NAM, among other distinctions—a very smart guy.

Aside from that, thank you for your courageous truth-telling in the incredibly demanding situation in
which we find ourselves.

My best,
John
