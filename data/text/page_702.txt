Dear Doc. Fauci,

this is Giuseppe Sarcina, the us correspondent of Corriere della Sera,
the main italian newspaper.

| understood that you are looking at the italian case with great
attention.

| wonder if you can grant me a short interview.

| have sent an email march 21. But then | saw that you spoke with an
other italian newspaper. So | would like to have a chance to have your
voice for our Readers as well. Corriere della Sera is a newspaper based
