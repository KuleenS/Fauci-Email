On March 15, 2020 the drug was approved in China with the name Favilavir for the treatment of
influenza.!2!] The drug was also approved for use in clinical trials for treating coronavirus
disease 2019 pneumonia.|4 1

On 22 March, 2020 Italy has approved the drug for experimental use against COVID-19 and has

begun conducting trials in 3 regions most affected by the disease.|2#] The Italian Pharmaceutical
Agency, however, has reminded the public that the existing evidence in support of this drug is

scant and preliminary. |31

Ebola virus trials[edit]

Some research has been done suggesting that in mouse models Favipiravir may have efficacy

against Ebola. Its efficacy against Ebola in humans 1s unproven. [24][25][26] During the 2014 West
Africa Ebola virus outbreak, it was reported that a French nurse who contracted Ebola while

volunteering for MSF in Liberia recovered after receiving a course of favipiravir. [27] A clinical
trial investigating the use of favipiravir against Ebola virus disease was started in Guéckédou,

Guinea, during December 2014,[28] Preliminary results showed a decrease in mortality rate in
patients with low-to-moderate levels of Ebola virus in the blood, but no effect on patients with

high levels of the virus, a group at a higher risk of death.[29! The trial design has been criticised
by Scott Hammer and others for using only historical controls.3°! The results of this clinical trial
were presented in February 2016 at the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic
Infections (CROI) by Daouda Sissokol3!! and published on March 1, 2016 in PLOS
Medicine. 32]

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)[edit]

On 17 March 2020, Chinese officials suggested that Favipiravir seemed to be effective in
treating COVID-19 in Wuhan and Shenzhen. [331[341(35]

A study on 80 patients comparing it to lopinavir/ritonavir found that it significantly reduced viral
clearance time to 4 days, compared to 11 for the control group, and that 91.43% of patients had
improved CT scans with few side effects,[361[37]

As of 23 March 2020, it seems that Japan and China have issued an export ban on the substance.
Japan and China are the only countries in which favirapir is produced and approved as a medical
compound. Some Chinese pharmaceutical companies assure that export rights are still granted
via international diplomatic means by the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information

Technolo gy (MITT) . (citation needed]
