Dr. Kavesh:
Thanks for your note. This issue is now being actively discussed at the Task Force meetings.
No guarantee, but | believe that there will be movement in that direction.
Best regards,

Dear Dr. Fauci,
The biggest concern of my hospital colleagues is the shortage of protective masks. If any research is
being done that might drive safe reuse of N-95 respirators, no one | know has seen it. These should be

simple studies to do.

If the virus is shown to die within a few days and moisture dries up, then the number of masks
needing disposal could drop drastically.

In that situation, each provider at risk could be given five N-95 masks, one for each day of the week.
The provider would wear the N-95 mask for one working day, say Monday. and then place it into a paper
bag in a secure location. The provider would not use that mask again until the following Monday; ie
seven days later.

The only question, then, would be: how many times can this be repeated? Will the mask lose any
protective qualities over time?

Please assign someone to do these studies soon.
I'm also very pleased that our national leaders now seem to be listening to you more closely.
Thank you for your efforts.
