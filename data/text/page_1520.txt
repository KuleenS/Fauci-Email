Dear Tony:

| am sorry to bother you with another request during this period. The Italian Embassy is
organizing its yearly Research Day (Giornata della Ricerca) that this year will be held strictly
online (via Zoom or other e-meeting tool) and centered entirely on the Coronavirus
pandemic.

The Italian Ambassador, Mr. Varricchio, would be delighted if you accept to be his guest of
honor at the event and asked me to informally enquire with you, before sending an official
invitation, if there is any chance you could participate. He understands how crazy your
schedule is during this crisis. They would like you to deliver a 30 min lecture on a theme of
your choice, preferably related to the state of the art of the pandemic management. The
tentative date for the event is between April 20 and April 30, but they are waiting to
finalize the date based on your preference, if you are able to accept (even in early May).

Please, let me know if you can accommadate this additional engagement. You will make
them very very happy!

All the best,

Paolo
