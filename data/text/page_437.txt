Subject: RE: Call for Dr. Fauci

Hi, Kim —

| spoke to Dr. Jacobs directly. He said that Dr. Michael Lockshin is a good friend/fellow
Cornell graduate (Dr. Jacobs also noted he went to Cornell) and gave him Dr. Fauci’s
number.

Dr. Jacobs and Dr. Alexander Tarakhovsky, a virologist at The Rockefeller Institute, would
like to speak to Dr. Fauci about the coronavirus. They have a theory that there may be
yeast involved because it is sticky and perhaps it came from the Chinese government.
They want to share their ideas and perhaps start a U.S. government effort “similar to The
Manhattan Project.” They do not want funding.

| thanked Dr. Jacobs for sharing his ideas and stated that | would pass along the message.
Should Dr. Fauci wish to speak to them, Dr. Jacobs can be reached at the number below
and Dr. Tarakhovsky can be reached ati OH GF

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kara
