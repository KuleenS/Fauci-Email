Duane, Yes. (asymptomatic or mild symptoms)
this is the worry at the very start, and it
remains the most critical. Hence even 1% of
infection for us -- can balloon out of proportion
and we can't handle. Shedding not only during
infection period, but also post-recovery. It's a
very long timeline that we have to deal with.
Then you have all the university siudents.
Students travelled to China and came back to
school, they asked health service if they
needed to quarantine or take any action,
theadvice -- no need. Those are missed
opportunities. Again, seasonal influenza
affects 8-10% Americans, 0.7% of those
infected required hospitalization, and morality
is roughly 0.1%. So it is easy to "calculate" all
these numbers backwards... So 20% of COVID-
19 infected may need hospitalization, mortality
is 10-30 times higher than seasonal flu. How
much can we tolerate before anyone would
spring into action? Keep in mind, some begin
to infect rapidly upon contracting the virus, the
incubation 1s so short (and so long) and
infectious too during that period (with much
being unknown).

Carter, I think you will expect heterogeneous
approaches from different communities in the
overall response strategy, since it depends on
the social setting and the demographics and
more importantly the local resources. We have
to optimize for sure.
