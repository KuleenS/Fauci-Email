How did technology play a role?

They’re managing massive amounts of data, because they’re trying to trace every contact of 70,000
cases. When they closed the schools, really, just the buildings closed. The schooling moved online.
Contact tracers had on-screen forms. If you made a mistake, it flashed yellow. It was idiot-proof.

We went to Sichuan, which is vast but rural. They’d rolled out 5G. We were in the capital, at an
emergency center with huge screens. They had a problem understanding one cluster. On one screen,
they got the county headquarters. Still didn’t solve it.

So they got the field team. Here’s this poor team leader 500 kilometers away, and he gets a video call on
his phone, and it’s the governor.

What about social media?

They had Weibo and Tencent and WeChat giving out accurate information to all users. You could have
Facebook and Twitter and Instagram do that.

isn’t all of this impossible in America?

Look, journalists are always saying: “Well, we can’t do this in our country.” There has to be a shift in
mind-set to rapid response thinking. Are you just going to throw up your hands? There’s a real moral
hazard in that, a judgment call on what you think of your vulnerable populations.

Ask yourself: Can you do the easy stuff? Can you isolate 100 patients? Can you trace 1,000 contacts? If
you don't, this will roar through a community.

isn’t it possible only because China is an autocracy?

Journalists also say, “Well, they’re only acting out of fear of the government,” as if it’s some evil fire-
breathing regime that eats babies. | talked to lots of people outside the system — in hotels, on trains, in
the streets at night.

They’re mobilized, like in a war, and it’s fear of the virus that was driving them. They really saw
themselves as on the front lines of protecting the rest of China. And the world.
