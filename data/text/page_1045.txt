Subject: Re: seeking your advice on a COVID-19 question
Dear Francis and Tony,

Thank you for a great conversation. Jacob, Bronwyn, and | stayed on a moment after you left and
talked about how inspired we are by each of you and by the camaraderie between you two. Jacob
added those two are national treasures, and Bronwyn and | wholeheartedly agreed.

Grateful for you both,
Pardis
