Good Evening Dr. Fauci,

My name is Liz Anderson, and I'm working the editor's desk
tonight at WTOP.

Are you available for a brief live interview (about 2 minutes
long) about what the latest COVID-19 developments? During
this evening's press conference, President Trump said you two
spoke about tt.

The Washington Post is also reporting that the CDC has been
informed about the first coronavirus case of unknown origin
confirmed in Northern California. We'd also like to talk about
that and what that could mean about the spread of this virus in
the states.

We have the following time slots open tonight:

9:10p
9:40p

NIH-001282
