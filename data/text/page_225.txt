Hi Purvi,

Here is the email from Dr Patel with his research and other relevant PubMed links. The body of the email provides
an idea of what he has been working on and how he hopes to contribute to the current outbreak.

I would be happy to connect Dr Patel with you (or someone you suggest) should you find the information provided
warrants further inquiry.

Warm Regards,
Heather
