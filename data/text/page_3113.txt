Dear Dr. Fauci,

lam amere clinician. But | have published repeatedly on a therapy which, | believe, will remedy patients
with coronavirus and spare a possible catastrophe, if the virus is as lethal as it appears.

The therapy is ozone. It can be performed, depending on the method, for mere pennies in materials. It is
not patentable, so, it lacks profitability needed for some payback for the basic research to get it
“approved”.

It attacks a key vulnerability on this virus and even Ebola. We got to 5 Ebola cases in Sierra Leone. All 5
recovered almost immediately. No sequela. No one has reported anything like that.

| have used ozone therapy for 33 years, ;longer than anyone in North America. It absolutely changed my
practice. | write essentially no prescriptions for antibiotics, including for Lyme disease. This therapy, |
recently published, might be the solution the world desperately needs for the emerging crisis in
resistant infections.

| am attaching 2 papers | recently published on ozone therapy, And a manuscript we just got done to
address corona virus, which | am trying to get published. It is not easy. The medical world is vested in
Pharmaceuticals.

| urge you to please look at this. Not patentable, it will never be a darling of industry. But just for that
reason (dirt cheap), it could be a savior for thousands or more who might die from a pandemic. | am
coming to you about this as one physicist came to President Roosevelt about harnessing the power of
the atom at the dawn of world war 2. |do hope you will take note of what | am forwarding to you.

The first file is a word document | am seeking to get published. Usually, an author will hold
up on making material like this public until he get published. However, with lives
immediately on the line, we want to alert people that the does exist an available very
inexpensive and extremely safe medical treatment for this and other infections.

If you have questions, please contact me here.
Sincerely,

NIH-002300
