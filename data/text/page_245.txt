Subject: Covid-19--Conference Call Invitation

On behalf of Ms. Gopinath:
Dear Professor Fauci:

We are contacting you in the context of the evolving spread of Covid-19, which is already impacting
livelihoods and economic activity in several countries. As you may know, the IMF publishes forecasts of
economic growth for member countries four times a year, as well as macroeconomic policy
recommendations. In that context, it would be invaluable for us to hear public health experts’ views on
the likely trajectory of the virus—the number of people that are likely to get infected in different
countries and the likely time path. We would also benefit from hearing experts’ views on the optimal
public health policy response in different types of countries (countries with stronger or weaker health
systems, different development levels, etc.), and the implied resource needs.

We are planning to set up a conference call with several experts to discuss these issues and were
wondering if you would be available to join us. If you would be interested in joining, would you be able
