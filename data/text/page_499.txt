therapeutic potential from stored SARS patient samples as well as COVID-19
patient samples.

10. Are the things we know about this new virus more than the ones we don't
know? Which are the main questions about it that remain to be answered?
New data are published about SARS-CoV-2 every day. However, we still have a
lot to learn. For example, we do not know why there are so few cases among

children, which is uncommon for a respiratory virus.

11. How worried should people outside China be about SARS-COV2? What is
the biggest danger from this virus?
. The risk to the general American public remains low at this time; however, this
could change and that is why we are treating the emergence of a novel
coronavirus as a very serious public health threat. We understand that
people may be worried. We ask that people not let fear or panic guide their
actions.

12. Which are the protective measures anyone should take against the new
virus? Do masks work?
The vast majority of people outside of China do not need to wear a mask. A
mask is more appropriate for someone who is infected than for people trying to
protect against infection.
