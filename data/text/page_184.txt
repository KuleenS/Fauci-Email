Dear Dr. Fauci,

I understand the need for the various stages of testing a new experimental vaccine. but in listening to
you give a timeline for any new vaccine for the corona virus, it struck me that perhaps a modified
approach might be considered. Why not allow early use of a vaccine that has passed a phase 1 safety
testing, similar to what was done fo: the Ebola vaccines. If a vaccine is shown to be reasonably safe,
why not allow its use it in more at-risk people (elderly, smokers) before phase 2 trials are finished. It
could also be helpful as with the Ebola vaccines to prevent transmission in hot spots of community
acquired infections. There doesn't seem to be much downside compared to the potential for
preventing many more deaths than was seen in the Ebola situation.

Sincerely yours,

Bill Buikema
