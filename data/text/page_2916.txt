Good morning Tony.

Given your most recent appointment, I wanted to show
you the courtesy of letting you know what I have already
provided to senior leaders at the White House regarding a
possible mitigating strategy until the definitive solution to
the CoV is available and implemented. The string below
includes additional information as to how titanium dioxide
can fit into both the White House and the
National/International solutions, and the open-source
website for the company. Please keep in mind that
because this product is already approved and in use in the
EU for a variety of commercial uses, the data provided
does not specifically address the applications I, and you,
are interested in. However, with a deep understanding of
the White House mission, I can say that there is not a big
leap in that thought migration.

Dr. Jackson has already provided the same material to
some of your White House Commission colleagues. I will
also be reaching out to another friend of mine from the
Bush-now-Trump Administration, Steve Biegun.
