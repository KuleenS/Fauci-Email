We are treating the emergence of a nove! coronavirus as a very serious public health
threat. However, the risk to the general American public remains low at this time. We
understand that people may be worried. We ask that people not let fear or panic guide
their actions.

Thanks for any help you can provide.

Cheers,

Rob
