I understand from contacts at WHO that Japan is testing everyone on
the Diamond Princess, so we should have a complete accounting of that
closed population (and thus a nice dataset to inform severity estimates).

Just talked to a lab director in Hong Kong U. They tested 3,600
passengers and crews on World Dream in 24 hours, all using the definitive
RT-PCR test. The tests were performed in government labs. They
disembarked everyone after 3 days (all came back negative). And they are
still performing contact tracing and monitoring on all at the moment.
