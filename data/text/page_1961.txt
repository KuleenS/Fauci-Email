Hi Dr. Fauci,

Hope you are doing well and thanks for your leadership during this pandemic
situation.

I have a medical degree and has experience in basic and clinical research for almost
30 years. Currently in clinical trials, doing studies monitoring. I would like to
volunteer during this COVID-19 situations. Please let me know if I can share in
anyway.

I appreciate it.
Best regards and be safe..
