evaluating COVID-19
patients in the
community based
clinics. Given the
projected shortages of
PPE, that just doesn’t
seem like the most
prudent approach.

Rather than expand
the care of potential
COVID-19 patients to
community based
outpatient clinics, I
would focus on
hospital care--ERs
and inpatient areas
(especially ICUs). I
would not pursue fit
testing for staff
working in outlying
clinics. As a strategy,
I suggested dividing
COVID patients into
two categories—_(1)
those with illness that
is mild enough to be
cared for at home
(self care or care by
other family
members); or (2)
those who are sick
enough to be seen in
the ER for possible
hospitalization. I
would refocus the
efforts of outlying
clinics away from
COVID and toward
keeping non-COVID
patients with the usual
mix of acute and
chronic illnesses we
see from hypertension
to CHF to diabetes,
