Gilead’s stock has been bolstered for weeks by expectations over remdesivir.

Remdesivir was discovered by Gilead in the hunt for antiviral drugs about a decade ago, and the
National Institutes of Health has partnered with the company to explore its benefits. It was shown to
work against an array of viruses in laboratory tests.

It showed effectiveness in primates infected with Ebola but failed in a trial in the Democratic Republican
of Congo in humans with the deadly disease. It has shown effectiveness as a preventive therapy in
primates for MERS, which is a coronavirus cousin of the Covid-19 virus.

There are no treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat coronavirus, but the
FDA has granted an emergency use authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine,
two decades-old anti-malarial drugs. There is scant evidence that the therapy works, but President
Trump has repeatedly boosted the promise of the drugs.

Even while multiple full clinical trials of remdesivir continue, Gilead hasbeen swamped with requests for
"compassionate use” of the drug. Under compassionate use rules, physicians can obtain experimental
drugs for their seriously ill patients when there is nothing else to try.

Gilead said last week that it had enough of the experimental drug on hand to treat up to 140,000 people
under compassionate use programs.
