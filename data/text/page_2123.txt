Importance: High

Hi Dr. Fauci — good evening. | represent TytoCare, a company that built the industry’s first and only all-
in-one medical device that pairs with a virtual exam, going beyond the means of audio and visual.
TytoHome, an OTC and FDA approved/cleared device is meant to either synchronously or
asynchronously examine a patient with capabilities to capture heart/lung/gastrointestinal sounds,
ear/throat/skin exams, and temperature.

Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, Tyto has experienced an influx of orders worldwide to support those
that need to be monitored when quarantined. ! would like to offer Tyto’s assistance here in the U.S. and
think through ways and opportunities that the product can make a difference.

Please see a few a couple of examples on how Tyto is making a difference below:

e Patient Quarantine/Discharge at Home
o Design: patients receive TytoHome or have it delivered for remote evaluation by infectious
disease specialists
= Example: Home Admission Service with TytoCare
e Create & manage quarantine locations, onsite or offsite
o Setup: Patients do a self-exam with TytoClinic while a provider evaluates them from a
distance
= Patient is remotely guided to fully disinfect the device and station before it’s
returned to staff for a second round disinfection
® Example: Nursing Home Triage

Thank you for all that you do during this difficult time.

Thanks,
David
