Since many of us have moved to remote work environments, you may
already be proficient with Zoom and other online meeting/collaboration
applications. | am attaching a ‘speaker guidelines’ file in case you have any
questions on how best to prepare for and stage your remote talk. We have
technical staff available to help you become familiar with Zoom and its
settings — such as “sharing your screen” (if you have slide presentations that
need to be shown during your talk). We can arrange for a training session this
week or next week. If you would like to schedule a session, please let me
know as soon as possible.

Dr. Dzau’s office will be in touch regarding the agenda for this session. If you
have any other questions, please let me know.

Regards, Jenny
