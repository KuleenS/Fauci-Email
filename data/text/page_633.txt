BTW, I just saw that you tried me earlier and I didn't respond.
I was in Geneva and evidently didn't have service. Hope we can
connect this time. Best number is my desk, +44 2035 251028.
Thanks again, JL

Hi Dr. Fauci: I'm working on a story about WHO DG Tedros and the
work that he's doing to contain the coronavirus epidemic. I'm
planning on discussing a number of themes, including that
responding to outbreaks has become the most visible job of the
DG in the past couple of decades. I'd also like to explore the
issue of how important it is that countries be as open as
possible about disease outbreaks, and that it's the DG's job to
encourage that and move countries toward greater transparency
and participation in battling outbreaks. Would you care to
comment on the job that Tedros is doing in these areas? Please
give me a call at +44 2035 251028 or let me know when and at
what number to call you. Thanks and regards, John Lauerman,
