Colleagues,

The momentum behind a 4*" COVID supplement seems to be building in the Congress even
more quickly than we had expected. We have received a TA request to provide rough numbers
for NIH efforts by Friday afternoon. With regrets for adding more burdens to the intense
efforts you are already engaged in, | ask that you submit a rough estimate of the first year and
the five year budget for your (i) IC-specific initiative(s) and/or your (ii) proposals to contribute
to economic recovery, no later than Friday April 3 at noon. This will be non-binding, and you are
free to revise it for the submission that we already asked you for by Friday COE. The only thing
we need Friday at noon is the budget — the narrative can come later in the day (or the night).

Please use the second page of the template we sent you yesterday to provide this draft budget.
Send to me.
