The new study could provide insight into why Italy’s death rate, at about 8% of
total infected people, is higher than in other countries.

The Rome-based institute has examined medical records of about 18% of the
country’s coronavirus fatalities, finding that just three victims, or 0.8% of the
total, had no previous pathology. Almost half of the victims suffered from at
least three prior illnesses and about a fourth had either one or two previous
conditions.

More than 75% had high blood pressure, about 35% had diabetes and a third
suffered from heart disease.

The average age of those who've died from the virus in Italy is 79.5. As of
March 17, 17 people under 50 had died from the disease. All of Italy’s victims
under 40 have been males with serious existing medical conditions.

While data released Tuesday point to a slowdown in the increase of cases, with
a 12.6% rise, a separate study shows Italy could be underestimating the real
number of cases by testing only patients presenting symptoms.
