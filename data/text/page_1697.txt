Colleagues,

Francis is sending out a note shortly tothe co-chairs of each of the ten trans-NIH initiatives, asking for
their assistance in putting together workplans and budgets for those projects. But in addition to these
trans-NIH activities, we invite ICDs to submit a short description of no more than two IC-specific ideas
that you believe merit consideration for support in a fourth supplemental bill, should one be put
forward. Please use the same template that is being used for the trans-NIH activities, but just check the
appropriate tick box. Your submission should include budget estimates for the first year and subsequent
outyears (for a total of 5 years). ———__________ a0}

eae) Pease send these to me by COE, Friday,

April 3°¢.

Finally, if we are asked about technical assistance regarding economic recovery, please send ideas for
that option. As part of this, Mike Lauer and Michael Gottesman will submit estimates on what might be
needed for extramural institutions and the IRP to “make them whole”. However beyond that there are
infrastructure, training, and other requests that would with help national economic recovery by creating
new jobs (construction, IT, biomedical, etc.) and help prepare the nation for COVID-202X. Please use the
same template that will be used for the trans-NIH activities (again, checking the correct box) and include
budget estimates for the first year and subsequent outyears (for a total of S years). Please send these to

me by COE, Friday, April 3°7.

Many thanks,
Larry
