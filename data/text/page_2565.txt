In an exception to policy, U.S. service members were authorized to
wear face masks in uniform “regardless of air quality conditions,”
according to the garrison’s Facebook page.

Fast-moving developments this week were a blow to South Korea’s
hope that the crisis was easing.

Instead, dozens of new cases were confirmed in recent days, with the
total number of infections soaring to 104 on Thursday, according to the
Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

U.S. Forces Korea said, “there remains zero confirmed cases of USFK
personnel with COVID-19.”

The virus first appeared in December in Wuhan, China, and spread to
nearly 30 countries. More than 2,000 people have died — most in
mainland China.

A South Korean man in his 60s died Wednesday at a hospital in the
southeastern city of Cheongdo and posthumously tested positive for the
virus, the KCDC said Thursday. It was South Korea’s first death from
the virus.

USFK raised the risk level for the military community to moderate
on Wednesday and banned all nonessential travel to Daegu due to an

outbreak linked to a church near the Army garrison in the city.

On Thursday, USFK added that all travel by American troops to, from
and around Daegu requires authorization from their leadership. The
precaution was “highly encouraged” for all family members, civilians
and contractors as well.

“All off-installation travel for all USFK populations should be
minimized to reduce potential contamination,” USFK announced on its
website.

U.S. Army Garrison Daegu, about 200 miles southeast of Seoul, also
said visitors not performing mission essential or official business would
be denied access as it implemented health checks at the gates.

Nonessential personnel were not required to go to work on Friday and
most activities would be suspended, including the schools, it said.

The garrison also recommended that members of the military
community avoid public places and transportation in the city, including
