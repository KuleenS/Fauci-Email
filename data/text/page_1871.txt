e Fauci was apoplectic about Trump’s tweet yesterday saying the cure couldn’t be
worse than the virus and indicating that he wants to reopen businesses soon.

e Fauci has been forceful privately that unproven drugs should not be advertised to
Americans as a panacea (and he of course has publicly spoken about these drugs).

e We are also reporting ina separate story that Larry Ellison is building a website for
the federal government that will collect data on the efficacy of remdesivir,
chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Our understanding is Fauci is vehemently
opposed to this idea and has pushed back on it, citing patient privacy concerns
with the website and collecting data in this way outside of an approved FDA trial.

Again, we’d love to speak with Or. Fauci and any others in your office who may have insight
into these particular issues and other aspects of the coronavirus response. Please feel free

to give me a call on my cell at any time atU_®)@
