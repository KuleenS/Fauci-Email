Lesley — we’ve been discussing this. Can you tell us exactly what would be involved in
this? How many minutes would you be looking for Dr. Fauci to speak? Would this be pre-
recorded, with Dr. Fauci solo? Or would it be done as a Zoom or something like that, with
an interaction between Dr. Faud and Avi?

Hi Courtney,

Hope you are staying well during these uncertain times. | am a Talent Producer for The
Webby Awards and had reached out to Dr. Fauci regarding being involved in our “virtual”
internet celebration which will showcase the artists, organizations, and creators using their
platforms to imagine a better tomorrow through information, education, movement,
comedy, all while inspiring audiences to take action to enact positive change.

Avi Schiffman is being celebrated as our Person of the Year and we would be honored if Dr
Fauci would “virtually” present him his honor. The official letter is below and would love
to discuss in more detail when you have a chance to review.
