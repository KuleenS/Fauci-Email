Subject: ASF: two things

Talked to FDA. They have written (and cleared with Gilead) a new sentence in place of what we had in
there about an EUA. Our release has been updated (attached) with the sentence highlighted below.

ALSO: Bill Hall called me to ask if you had alerted the Secretary to this (so the press release clearance
process isn’t the way he first learns of it). | told him | wasn’t sure. If you haven’t done so, perhaps you

wish to now?

As part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s commitment to expediting the development
and availability of potential COVID-19 treatments, the agency has been engaged in sustained and
ongoing discussions with Gilead Sciences regarding making remdesivir available to patients as
quickly as possible, as appropnate.
