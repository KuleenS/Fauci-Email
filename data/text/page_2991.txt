Let me know if that sounds OK. We will likely not have a cleared version out of CDC until late Saturday
at the earliest.

Take care,

Subject: Redfield/Fauci nCoV op-ed

 

 

CDC and NIH folks,

Per some discussion after the presser, we'd like Dr. Redfield and Dr. Fauci to pen an op-ed regarding the
reasons/thinking behind the policy announced today. | assume the right building blocks for it would be
the remarks they made today — which | believe you all should have the copy/notes for? | have the
Secretary’s, which we’ll be sending around/posting shortly and I’ll make sure to re-up it here so you all
have it.

It would be great to have a draft of this cleared to get to the WH over the weekend. (| anticipate faster-
than-average clearance from them!)

Please let me know how | can help with this.

Best,
Patrick
