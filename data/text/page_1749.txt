Tony, first and foremost.... thank u for ur continued leadership and integrity in the “
combat zone”.

I know ur drinking from the proverbial fire hose so I would not send anything ur
way if | didn’t think 1t may have merit to address our current challenge with
Coronavirus.

I e mail introduced u to this group some time ago. Their science has advanced and in
particular there seems to be a potential opportunity to address the sometimes lethal “
cytokine storm” in some coronavirus patients as described in the attached e mail.

So I forward to you for your consideration as an adjunct.

On a daily basis I receive numerous “ ideas” to address coronavirus from many well
intended people. A few have merit. Is there a Fed innovation review group that some
of these potential ideas could be funneled too?

I pray for you and your family

Be well

Rich
