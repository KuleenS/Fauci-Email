Carter,

Just listened in to our state COVID-19 response effort
update. Georgia has no COVID-19 cases yet, and hence
they remain in the containment period where they place
medium-risk individuals on supervised monitoring of home
quarantine, advise them to take temperature daily and
report any respiratory symptoms (24/7). Educate them not
to show up in ED, or any place without facilitation. To
avoid potential disease spread, they are advised to remain at
home.

The next stage will be mitigation when a confirmed case is
reported. That will initiate the pandemic planning and
community-based NPI will be considered. This includes
social distancing -- telework, teleclass, etc.

I assume at cities where there are confirmed local COVID-
19 cases, the public health leaders have already begun the
mitigation phase now and hence are practicing some degree
of social distancing and rolling out telework, and various
strategies to protect health in the population and to
maintain business continuity already. Is that true or they
are still waiting to execute their operations?

There are not many tests needed here in Georgia. But rapid
robust and reliable testing kits (Tracey's reporting of
current bottleneck) remain critical in all communities with
positive cases. If we have such means, testing can also be
conducted (sampling) on some flu-like cases at strategic
selected cities also.
