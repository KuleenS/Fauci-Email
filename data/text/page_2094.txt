Subject: Hypothesis for reducing fatalities from Coronavirus

Dear Dr. Fauci / to whom it may concer:

I am not a medical doctor but ] have an idea. I know you have every expert on earth
working on this virus. I am watching the attempts to slow the transmission and
"flatten the curve."

What if we could reduce the fatality rate? Wouldn't that be huge and assist in
reducing the panic ?

I am hearing that hospitals are going to be short on respirators and that the virus
attacks the lungs. My idea - might help people to breath more efficiently.

Summary:

Here is my idea: Doctors need to utilize methods that endurance athletes have used
in the past to increase their red blood cells in order to increase their body's
blood-oxygen carrying capacity.

Further description:

Athletes like Lance Armstrong used blood doping and other ways to increase their
Erythropoietin (EPO). This was called cheating in sports. However, the results
gave him an advantage because his body could get more (VO-2 max) oxygen with a
single breath compared to others. This helped Armstrong to become more "super
human." I agree that this should be illegal in sports. However, I think it would be
great if a person was fighting for their life to be super human.
