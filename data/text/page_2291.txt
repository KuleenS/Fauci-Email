Dear Dr. Fauci,

We greatly appreciate your willingness to participate in the 2020
Stanford Drug Discovery Symposium (SDDS). As you undoubtedly
know, with the further spread of the novel coronavirus COVID-19,
Stanford is taking precautionary measures to minimize any
preventable spread of this viral disease. After much consideration,
we feel it is in the best interest of our speakers, guests, and
community to cancel the April 20-21, 2020, symposium.

We apologize for the inconvenience this may cause in your
schedules. We do hope that you will agree to be our guest speaker
NEXT year for our April 19-20, 2021. As soon as your schedule
allows, please let us know if you would be able to speak at our 2021
SDDS meeting.
