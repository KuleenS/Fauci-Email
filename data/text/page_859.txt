Dear Dr. Pape:

| lead the World Health Organization (WHO) delegation to the United Nations and know of you through
Tony Fauci and Henry Masur, (0. For nearly 5 years immediately
preceding my appointment at WHO,, | was an technical advisor at Hépital Sacré-Coeur in Milot and
remain in close contact with institution. Because of this, PAHO leadership asked me to join their COVID-
19 planning discussions related to Haiti. | understand from Henry that you have been appointed by
MSPP to coordinate COVID-19 preparedness and response activities. If you have some time available on
Friday, it would be good to talk via Zoom or Webex. | can arrange this and would plan to have the

PAHO deputy director as well as other PAHO officials on the line. Would you be available Friday
afternoon for such a discussion? If not Friday, anytime over the weekend would also likely work on our
end.

Thanks so much for considering this.
With best regards,

Stewart Simonson
