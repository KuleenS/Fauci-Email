Story contains these crucial grafs:

In Washington, where it was still Sunday afternoon, a fierce debate
broke out: The State Department and a top Trump administration
health official wanted to forge ahead. The infected passengers had no
symptoms and could be segregated on the plane in a plastic-lined
enclosure. But officials at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention disagreed, contending they could still spread the virus.
The CDC believed the 14 should not be flown back with uninfected
passengers.

“It was like the worst nightmare,” said a senior U.S. official involved
in the decision, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe
private conversations. “Quite frankly, the alternative could have
been pulling grandma out in the pouring rain, and that would have
been bad, too.”
