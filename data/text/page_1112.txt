Dear Dr. Fauci,

| just wanted to say thank you for everything you are doing to educate us in this
country, and keep us safe during this horrendous coronavirus pandemic. | can’t
even begin to imagine how difficult it is to maintain your composure and
persevere with your focus, being constantly in the public eye and also trying to
expertly guide a president who seems more preoccupied with his own image (and
sound of his own voice), and political aspirations than with the actual well being
of his country’s citizens.

By now, it should be perfectly clear to us that we can’t have a healthy economy
without a healthy population.
