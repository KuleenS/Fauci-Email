Janet:

Nothing definite on this. To my knowledge, no one has specifically looked at real cross-reactivity although there
have been speculation that because there is about 80-90% homology between nCoV and SARS that there may be
some use of the mAbs made against SARS for nCoV. I have not seen any data where people took sera from
patients with nCoV and checked if it neutralized SARS and vice versa.

Best,
Tony

Dear Tony: I have a background question as I am wading through reading as much as possible on the 2019
coronavirus. Do we know if the antibodies that can neutralize SARS are also effective against the 2019 coronavirus?
] may be completely off track, but just trying to think through some things I am reading.
