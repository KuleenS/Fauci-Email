Subject: BuzzFeed News: 2019-nCoV vaccine development questions
Dr. Fauci,

As you may recall, I'm a science reporter at BuzzFeed News. We wonder if you might have any
perspective (or might recommend someone to comment) for a novel coronavirus story we are writing
for this weekend, regarding vaccine efforts.

In short, we wonder how you see an eventual vaccine playing a role in the future of the outbreak? CDC
has described the virus as not mutating as much as influenza -- does that suggest a vaccine would
provide more than seasonal protection?

In the long term, we had a few other questions. Is this something you could see added to the MMR
protocol for the general public, or only in regions where there are local outbreaks (is there an analogy to
SARS or MERS vaccines in this contemplated use)? Is there any aspect of a race against time in vaccine
development if this coronavirus is seasonal like influenza?

We are basically trying to understand where a vaccine fits into the future response to this new virus. we
asked you these sort of questions about the Zika vaccine efforts and your perspective really helped a lot.
Apologies for all the questions, if you had any perspective, we'd be grateful
