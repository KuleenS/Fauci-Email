Wuhan. The reason is that, firstly, there is no commercial interest to pharmaceutical manufacturers,
and secondly, such outbreaks may not return after the extinction.
What do you think of these views?

2 For the Wuhan virus vaccine being developed, the epidemic is likely to be eliminated after three
months, so is it still necessary to develop a vaccine?

3 You can talk about SARS. How much does a vaccine against SARS actually play?

Looking forward to your reply.
