Subject: CoV collaboration with Polish Medical Research Agency

Dear Doctor Fauci,

| hope this e-mail is finding you well and your efforts in fight against Coronavirus epidemics
is giving some effects. As you know in Poland we have currently 15 cases of CoV infection
and we are also fighting mostly with general society worries than epidemics. We would like
also to take part in research on CoV vaccine or drug and Polish Medical Research Agency is
planning to start financing some project on it as soon as possible. Both polish medical
universities and institutes are fully prepared to take part in such project.

On behalf of Polish Minister of Health Prof. Lukasz Szumowski | would like to kindly ask you
for some support and collaboration options with NIH in this very delicate issue. Maybe NIH
can take some advisory role in our scientific project or Polish scientists may take some part
in your work bilaterally.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
Radostaw Sierpifiski MD, PhD
President of Medical Research Agency in Poland
