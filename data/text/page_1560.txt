I hope you are well and I wanted to check in to see how you are doing in
this scary and traumatic time for our world.

During these times, I'm especially thankful for the training I
received from the Fogarty Institute. I remember your wise words
at our Fogarty orientation in 2011- on why investing in Global
health is so critical. No truer words have been spoken especially at
times like these!

I'm currently communicating with my former colleagues in Zambia
(Mpanji and Innocent pictured here with

s://www.thermofisher.com/blog/behindthebench/using-sanger-sequencing-to-
detect-drug-resistance-mutations-in-hiv-in-zambia/) from CIDRZ to see how
testing can be brought up via the public health infrastructure in
place currently. Thankfully, the number of cases is very low,
although the unreported cases are much higher than likely
captured
(https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b4
8e9ecf6). My friend who is a Lieutenant Physician actually likely
contracted COVID-19 in January and wrote that she and others
had treated a patient returning from Wuhan who was pregnant of
respiratory illness upon coming back to Lusaka to deliver, only to
die of pleural effusion later. They subsequently developed flu-like
symptoms and resolved, but these are the types of cases that
likely go undetected and can potentially contribute to community
spread of the disease.

 

Thank you again for being such a wonderful role model, and I look
to leaders like you and Dr. Fauci to help our nation think with
prudent but difficult decisions.

Kind regards,
Lillian
