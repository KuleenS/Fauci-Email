Dear Prof. Anthony Fauci,

Thank you. Dr. Catharine provided me useful information. As the epidemic develops, here are a few new
questions to ask. Chinese readers want to know the opinions of foreign independent experts

1 Some media said Wuhan virus’ fatality rate approaches that of the flu, saying that people need not
panic. What do you think of this view? In reality, Chinese residents are already scared and are already
rushing to buy masks.

2 RO is a developing number, and it is not easy to calculate. Does it make sense to talk about RO at this
stage?

3 You had talked about asymptomatic patients, and how public health workers should treat
asymptomatic people? AND why are some viral infections asymptomatic? Can they wear masks to help
prevent epidemics?

4 To what extent will the closure of Wuhan prevent the epidemic?

Looking forward to your reply.

Best
