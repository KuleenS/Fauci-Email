NIAID strategic a for COVID- 19

 

This is a very old RFA. I am sending it because it was NIAID's first attempt to build research capacity for the Level
3 and Level 4 pathogens after the Anthrax events. The current versions of the RFAs have been limited competitions
and are a less relavant.

 

With best regards,

Carl
