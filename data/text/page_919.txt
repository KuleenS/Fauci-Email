“Otto e mezzo”

Italy’s most influential political daily talk show shown on prime-time on La7 TV. Through interviews with
elected political figures and candidates for office, commentators, and journalists, the show focuses on
international political news and economy with a special focus on Italy and Europe. Beginning in

2008 "Otto e Mezzo" became Lilli Gruber’s way to keep her commitment to holding those in power
accountable by asking questions and touching on topics citizens are curious about. Otto e

Mezzo airs Monday to Saturday from 8:35pm to 9:10pm. Within this time-frame Paolo Pagliaro’s news
column “Il Punto” stands out for accuracy and thoughtfulness by pulling the thread on the highest rated
issues in an agenda. During the current season Otto e Mezzo has become Italy's most watched political
talk show reaching an average of 7.3% of share with 2.5 million viewers per day.
