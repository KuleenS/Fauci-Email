In addition, I'd be grateful if you'd consider writing another First Opinion for us, maybe on lessons
you've learned regarding other outbreaks and how that might be relevant with coronavirus -- or
whatever you'd like.

Your voice of course is very important and authoritative and we'd be grateful to have it again in STAT.

All best,

Rick
