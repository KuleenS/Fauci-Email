Hi Dr. Anthony Fauci,

I saw you on Meet the Press this weekend and you were so awesome! Very
informative, calm, assuring but with the right amount of instilling the need for us all
to move forward with the appropriate caution for ourselves. It's extremely reassuring
to have you leading and guiding us during this time.

I'm emailing you because I work at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in

. Our administration initially said if any Covid-19 patient came into the
hospital needing emergeny care and needing to be admitted they would be given an
N95 mask and put in a negative pressure room. Now they reversed that decision and
said they'd be put in a regular positive pressure roomn even after | showed them the
CDC's recommendation for both confimed and possible Covid-19 cases needing to
be placed in negative pressure rooms/AIIR.

Well tonight a possible Covid-19 patient came to the Emergency Room and had to
be admitted to the ICU. The patient was given just a regular mask and put in an
elevator to the ICU. Management would not confirm 1f the patient was in a negative
pressure room and wouldn't give staff N95 masks. I again showed them the CDC
website hospital protocol Covid-19 recommendations but same response. And even
was yelled at by the hospital nursing supervisor for asking about It.

I feel this is not safe at all for other patients, visitors and staff if the air is being
recirculated not vented outside or through a hepa filter before recirculating back
