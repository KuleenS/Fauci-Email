Subject: Nursing homes are ground zero for COVID19 -- and what more we can do to save lives
in the pandemic

Dear Colleague,
Two weeks ago it was clear that COVID-19 would become a pandemic, and, sadly it has.

Now the United States is in the acceleration phase and cases, clusters, and large outbreaks will occur in
many parts of the country.

| outline steps we can take to reduce the harms. The core concept to protect the most vulnerable. First,
restrict visits to nursing homes. All of us can play a part reducing infections. Medically vulnerable people
can protect themselves by reducing social contacts. I’m not sure I’d go quite as far as my good friend Bill
Schaffner and say they should become semi-hermits, but that’s certainly a helpful frame of reference.
Health care needs to get much safer, and ready to surge safely. And we need to stop mass gatherings,
consider telework, figure out whether closing schools will help, and more.

 

Read what I’ve posted about ground zero in the COVID-19 pandemic in the US here.

I’ve shared on Twitter if you’d like to disseminate.

 

We'll all be working together to protect as many people as quickly as possible.
Thank you,

Tom
