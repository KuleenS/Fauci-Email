Hi Dr. Fauci,

I'm now back in my office. I typed the original message on
phone. I just noticed a bunch of typos. Below is a better
version.

Regards,

Erik

Dear Dr. Fauci,

You're beyond busy but I hope you read this message.

 

 

y
this so you don't think I'm a paranoid freak. I'm convinced you
already know the outbreak is way past the point of containment,
and, unfortunately, herd immunity will soon ensue. Then,
outbreak 2 will happen shortly after, and, hopefully, not ad
infinitum.

I'm writing to make sure you already know or at least suspect
everything I'm about to tell you. I need to clear my conscience
