Doctors in Japan are using the same drug in clinical studies on coronavirus patients with mild to
moderate symptoms, hoping it will prevent the virus from multiplying in patients.

But a Japanese health ministry source suggested the drug was not as effective in people with
more severe symptoms. “We’ve given Avigan to 70 to 80 people, but it doesn’t seem to work
that well when the virus has already multiplied,” the source told the Mainichi Shimbun.

The same limitations had been identified in studies involving coronavirus patients using a
combination of the HIV antiretrovirals lopinavir and ritonavir, the source added.

In 2016, the Japanese government supplied favipiravir as an emergency aid to counter the Ebola
virus outbreak in Guinea.

Favipiravir would need government approval for full-scale use on Covid-19 patients, since it was
originally intended to treat flu.

A health official told the Mainichi the drug could be approved as early as May. “But if the results
of clinical research are delayed, approval could also be delayed.”
