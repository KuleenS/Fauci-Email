Hello Dr. Fauci,

I live a very normal life in a Tennessee suburb. We have

always kept a modest supply of important survival items in our home, so we are
prepared, not panicked. We are carefully following the information and facts
regarding the Coronavirus and taking the appropriate safety suggestions.

The reason for my email today is to thank you for your expertise. You must be
exhausted from the stress. Not to mention having to continually repeat yourself...
and stretch your political diplomacy to the breaking point while walking the fine line
between stating facts and debunking myths (or outright lies).

Please know that my family and I thank you for your continued professionalism,
swift communication of facts and overall leadership while we ride this rollercoaster

with our neighbors and the rest of the world.

Sincerely,
Robyn Cotter
