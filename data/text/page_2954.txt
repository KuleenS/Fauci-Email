Subject: note to Patty -- and Tony Fauci

Greetings Patty and Tony -- | see you on TV constantly guiding us through the terrain on our
preparedness for outbreaks such as what we have seen in China. ! want to see if | can add one more
request to your pile to think about....and | am trying to see if what | am suggesting might work right
before your Aspen talk next Tuesday at noon.

In addition to my great role at The Hill, | am host of a new show called "The Bottom Line” on Al Jazeera
English that runs four times a week on their global network and is garnering between 100k-200k views a
week on YouTube in the US. The show is doing really well and is a 24 minute panel discussion of three
experts on a single topic that I facilitate. | would love to have you, Tony, be the anchor commentator on
what we should do not only on the coronavirus but in general on the infrastructure of pandemic
preparedness in the country -- sort of a shorter form of that great PBS show you did called Invisible
Killers.

We would want to tape in our studio at 21st and M Streets NW from 11:00 am - 11:30 am (we don't go
over), or | could move it 15 to 30 minutes earlier if you like next Tuesday, 11 February. | know you have
to be at Aspen at noon (I was invited too) -- so | could take you if you like.

| realize that this may be too much. -- but in these times, | think it's important to get smart commentary
and analysis out there -- and | think | can add a couple hundred thousand eyeballs and ears to the
millions you are already reaching. The producers are also able to provide car and driverf @) 2

Hope this might work my friend. | may send a short form of this to your cell phone.
Call me if you want to chat, either of you, at OG.

all best, STEVE
