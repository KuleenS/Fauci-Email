How do you interpret the surface stability data?

Copper seems to have some virucidal effect, as is seen with other viruses. Plastic and stainless steel
don’t have much of an effect on the virus itself, and the virus persists for some time. As for cardboard,
difficult to interpret because the surface absorbs a good deal, but there is some immediate decay.

Should we be concerned about packages based on your data?

This is of far lower concern than droplet and other fomite transmission. Typical shipping will allow ample
time for viral decay, and the cardboard itself seems to have some direct effect on the virus (either
through absorption or other effect). For example, in the experiment, Vincent applied

10e5 viral particles/mL and it drops 2 logs to 10e3 immediately, indicating that either due to absorption
or direct effect on the virus.

Of course, if a mail carrier coughs on a package and then someone touches it directly after, there may
be a risk. The typical shipping situation is likely not a concern.

Why are SARS-CoV-2 vs. SARS-CoV-1 different?

For the cardboard data in particular, there is a difference seen between SARS-CoV-2 and 1, which is
likely due to error/variation in surface.
