Dinah and Ned,

It was a pleasure talking to you about what you are considering. As we discussed, here is the NIAID Strategic Plan
that was just published, and two models of funding opportunity announcements for you to consider as models. I also
think the Cancer Centers have aspects of ccllaboration, shared facilities, and research focus that you can borrow. So
much of what NIAID has built is modeled on the Cancer Centers.
