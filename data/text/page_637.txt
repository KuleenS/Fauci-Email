All: Below is an outline of questions for tomorrow at CFR. Sorry to get this to you late but it seems the news
changes everyday. As you will sec I focus mostly on coronavirus as I suspect that’s where the interest will be but get
to bio weapons toward the end.

I am happy to take additional questions or suggestions. These sessions go quickly and we have time for Q and A so I
doubt [ will get through it all but wanted you all to have something to look at.

Thanks again for doing this tomorrow.

Best
Fran
