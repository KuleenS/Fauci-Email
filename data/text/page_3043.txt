Hi Dr. Fauci,
I'm a senior writer with Canada's public broadcaster, CBC News, and I'm working on a national feature

story about the containment efforts of the coronavirus outbreak and what future scenarios could be
possible with the coronavirus globally.

You spoke with my colleague Kelly Crowe by phone recently, and I'm hoping you could spare a few
minutes by phone to talk about the possibility and implications of the outbreak becoming endemic.

Would it be possible to speak briefly by phone this week? | would only need a few minutes of your time
and your expertise would be very beneficial for Canadians in their understanding of this story.

Thanks very much,

Adam
