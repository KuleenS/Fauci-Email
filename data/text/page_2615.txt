isolation for those who are
infected and voluntary home
quarantine for otherwise well (but
exposed and potentially infected)
household contacts? Having all
the suspected patients coming in
to clinics to be screened really
defeats the purpose. So how
would very large numbers of
outpatients get screened? Home
screening? Drive thru screening?
Or creating a free standing
screening facility for rapid
screening? Has anyone thought
this thru (how you screen for
disease plus promote
adherence/compliance to home
isolation and home quarantine and
shift outpatient care of patients
with mild disease to
telephone/home care to protect
outpatient clinic staff? Looking for
practical solutions.

Just to remind you, here are the
estimates of demand (assuming we
would need to screen all ILD—
about 88K per day in primary care
clinics across the US.
