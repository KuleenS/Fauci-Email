Additionally, | have attached an invitation letter from Mr. Rubenstein to Dr. Fauci for your
convenience. The Economic Club has the ability to turn around an event in a relatively short
period of time. As you may recall, our events typically take place at breakfast, lunch or dinner,
at downtown Washington, D.C. hotels. Events that feature a prominent world leader, such as
Dr. Fauci, generally attract a select audience of over 500 members and guests from among
Washington’s business and government leaders, as well as the diplomatic corps.

We understand the complexities and constraints of Dr. Fauci’s schedule and can be responsive
to his needs. If none of the dates above work with Dr. Fauci’s schedule, please suggest some
that will and we will work with David to confirm a date and begin the process. | have copied
Judi lrastorza, who | believe you have worked with in the past, and she will coordinate anything
you need.

Sincerely,
Mary
