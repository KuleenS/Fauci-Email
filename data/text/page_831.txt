Thanks for the heads up. Is there any more detailed description of the precise
clinical manifestations? They describe a “multisystem inflammatory state”. It is
vasculitis or anything more specific? Could be an infectious agent that has
nothing to do with SARS-CoV-2 infection even though some children are
circumstantially infected with SARS-CoV-2or it could be a post-SARS-CoV-2
inflammatory syndrome, perhaps a Kawasaki syndrome-like disease. Please keep
me informed if you hear any further information.

Best regards,
Tony
