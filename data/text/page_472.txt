w/ COVID-19

Importance: High

YT]: Billet,

 

 

 

Good evening:

Attached for your review are draft materials to communicate NIH’s preparation for potential receipt of
patients with COVID-19 to the NIH Clinical Center (timing TBD), including:

1. Rollout plan
2. All staff email
3. Statement

These materials were reviewed by Rick Davey, Tara Palmore, and Courtney Billet. | am developing a list
of potential Qs and will work with CC and NIAID folks to develop responses, but | wanted to get these
products into review in the interest of time.

Best,
Renate
