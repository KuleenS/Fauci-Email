Subject: Happenings Radio Q+A...

Hi there,
This is Cassidy G-D from Happenings Magazine & Radio in Kenosha, WI- we ever so briefly spoke on the phone
earlier today.

I was reaching out with the hope of getting you on our radio program for a 20-30 minute Q+A in which we would
talk about the Coronavirus and more specifically the impact it is having on the Diamond Princess Cruise ship along
with anything you would like to talk about regarding infectious diseases and or your position as director of the

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Please let me know if you have any interest in being on the air with us and I would be happy to provide further
details. You can also get ahold of me by our office phone at 262-564-8800.

Hope you are well and I look forward to hearing back from you, Cassidy G-D

NIH-001819
