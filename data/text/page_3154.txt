Dear Mr. Fauci,

! am hoping that this email reaches you as | saw this email address on line on the NIH
website.

As we as the public get to hear, read and see with the current coronavirus scare, here in
the US and worldwide, it is comforting to have professionals and experts like you, who
really know what they are talking about, what is going on, what can be done, timelines,
action plans, and inform the public ina reliable and comforting way, yet being very
transparent, informing the public on social media.

Kudos to you sir and please keep up the excellent work.

Sincerely,

Mur. Civelek
