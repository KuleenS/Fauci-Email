Dear David et al.,

Thanks for forwarding this very thoughtful document, which presents a series of
important recommendations — most of which | agree with. | don’t know if you saw
Friday’s announcement (attached) of the new public private partnership called
ACTIV (for Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines), but it
has taken on most of the points you raise in sections 1 — 3 of your letter. | share
your hopes that remdesivir will show benefit, and the current large NIH-sponsored
RCT has completed enrollment and should reveal results in about a month. But of
course we want to test multiple other interventions — both small molecules and
antibody-based therapies, so we need our trial system to be optimized like never
before. | will share your letter with the leaders of ACTIV, who are working with
unprecedented speed to prioritize the next set of therapeutic candidates as well as
pushing vaccine development programs to adopt exceptionally creative trial
designs to test safety and efficacy (with full engagement by FDA).

Best regards, Francis
