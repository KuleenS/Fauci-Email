Subject: Record a short interview with me fora UPenn course?
Dear Dr. Fauci,

| am embarrassed to admit that | was not familiar with your name when | read the story about you in
today’s NY Times, but | was most impressed by the statement in the first sentence that you are "widely
respected for [your] ability to explain science without talking down to [your] audience”.

I’m putting together the first offering of CLCH 300: Communicating Science, as part of the University of
Pennsylvania’s new online Certificate in Climate

Change. (https://Ipsonline.sas.upenn.edu/academics/certificates/climate-change) A brief recorded
conversation with you about your strategies for communicating without being patronizing would be
most enlightening for my students.

The students in this course will be coming from a wide variety of backgrounds, and potentially from all
over the globe. | think they would love to hear from a scientist who is so good at communicating his field
of study to different audiences. And let’s face it, as soon as you say “NIH” as COVID-19 swirls around the
globe, their ears will certainly perk up! | think the students would find our interview very engaging and
informative.

The first run of the course will be from May 26 to July 20, 2020, but we can record the interview (online)
any time, since | know you are already over-extended right now. | think 15 minutes would be plenty, and
| would be happy to send you questions that | plan to use to guide the conversation in advance. If a
synchronous conversation is impossible given your schedule, | would be happy to just send you a couple
of questions and ask you to use them to guide a 10-15 minute video that you record yourself.

Please let me know what you think of this, and I will send you the syllabus when it’s finalized, including
where our interview would fit. Then | can begin the process of coordinating this with the Associate
Director of our Online Learning Studio.

Sincerely,
Elizabeth
