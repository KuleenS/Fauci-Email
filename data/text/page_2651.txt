Quarantine of potentially infected
but symptom-free contacts during
an epidemic). This paper
identifies those conditions where
SM or Q is preferred. Figure 1 1s
useful for understanding the
challenges given the picture that
seems to be emerging with this
virus. This outbreak seems closer
to pandemic flu than SARS in
terms of transmission dynamics
(and hence the NPIs we would
need to employ).

Lastly, another person, Bob Glass
at Los Alamos, also did work on
this separately from the MIDAS
group. He actually began this
work as part of a science fair
project for his daughter (using
social contacts of his daughter and
her classmates at school to model
disease transmission). He knew
someone at VA who forwarded his
work to us (chain of
transmission). Early on (even
before the MIDAS group modeled
TLC), we had a “Eureka” moment
when we graphed his data in Excel
(I can share that single graph to
anyone interested). Bob Glass was
also interested in trying to
determine when you could let up
on the NPIs during a pandemic.
