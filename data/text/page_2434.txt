Tony, as always and for many decades and most importantly now, thank you for being the voice of
reason and integrity that emanates from the political swamp to quell uncertainty and fear. Ironically
your words now as a “ vaccine” against the disease of public fear and uncertainty may be as important
as the eventual immunologically derived vaccine against coronavirus you are working on.

Be well,

Rich Carmona
