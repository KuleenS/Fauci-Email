Dear Dr. Fauci;

lliveinQG 8) Last week there was the first incidence
of the Coronavirus. The officials in Media gave no true information on the
individual but that it was a female. When questioned by the press as to the location
in which the individual was - the response was that that information could not be
given. I have also heard that it is in a violation of a person’s privacy. No one is
asking for the person’s name or address. If the public were given the general area of
the affected person they would probably stay clear of the area. The people directly in
the area would be more cautious. Knowing where the person frequented, for
example, the market would be pertinent in preventing spread of this virus. There is
so much information about this virus that is unknown yet most officials continue to
underscore the severity of this virus.

Sincerely,
Terri Davis
