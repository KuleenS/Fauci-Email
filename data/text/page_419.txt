known as the
cecum.

His Sydney clinic
has done 1,800 of
the procedures,
which

he jokingly dubs
“transpoosions,”
over 25 years.
Borody, 62,

says the treatment
has helped patients
with ailments
ranging

from autism to
pseudomembranou
S colitis, a resilient
infection

that causes
abdominal pain,
loose bowel
movements and
fever.

“The next day their
diarrhea stops,” the
doctor says.

After the procedure,
he asks patients to
avoid treatments
that

may damage their
gut flora. Three
studies presented
at the

American College
of
Gastroenterology’s
meeting in October
indicate fecal
transplants can help
with bouts of
diarrhea
associated with the
bacterium
Clostridium difficile.
