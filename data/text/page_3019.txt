Subject: Coronavirus - reporter's questions

Hi Dr. Fauci: We are updating our coronavirus story periodically, keeping it factual and
level-headed, and | have seen your comments on NPR Friday and in the NY Times over the
weekend, so | hope you could comment very briefly for our story:

-- What's your expectation for whether this will become a pandemic?

The novel coronavirus outbreak will likely become a pandemic. We know the virus is very
transmissible. The infection continues to accelerate and there is efficient transmission in
china. If sustained transmission also occurs in other countries throughout the world, the
outbreak would fulfill the definitive of a pandemic

-- Pandemic does not necessarily equate to a terrible situation, compared to, say bad flu
seasons. What's your expectation on the potential severity of this coronavirus?

It is difficult to predict the severity at this time. Even if the mortality rate of a virus remains
low, if it is easily transmissible, the global impact can be significant.

-- And your suggestion to people in the U.S. who might be very concerned?

NIH-002195
