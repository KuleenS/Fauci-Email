identify for carrying out these studies. In view of the worldwide SARS-CoV-2
emergency, we’d like your assistance in getting this off the ground ASAP.

I can be reached any time ati OU

Dear Drs. Fauci and Redfield,

Scientists in my laboratory at Columbia University are actively engaged in design

strategies to cope with the new strain of coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, which has

caused a global public health emergency. We have embarked on a project entitled

“Nucleotide Analogues as Inhibitors of Viral Polymerases”. We provide
a summary of this work below.

Coronaviruses such as the newly discovered virus from Wuhan, China, 2019-

nCoV, and the viruses that cause SARS and MERS, have resulted in regional and

global public health emergencies. Based on our molecular insight that the
hepatitis C virus and the coronavirus use a similar viral genome replication
mechanism, we reasoned that the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA
(Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) for the treatment of hepatitis C will also inhibit the

above coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV. To develop broad spectrum anti-viral

agents, we further describe a novel strategy to design and synthesize viral
polymerase inhibitors, by combining the ProTide Prodrug approach used in the
development of Sofosbuvir with the use of 3’-blocking groups that we have
previously built into nucleotide analogues that function as polymerase
terminators.

Please let me know if you would like to receive the full manuscript.

Thank you very much for your consideration.
