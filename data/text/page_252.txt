Subject: My OpEd on the WSJ coming out Friday on convalescent serum for Coronavirus

 

Dear Tony,

| just had an OpEd accepted in the WSJ proposing the use of convalescent sera to stem the coronavirus
epidemic. The text of the OpEd is below in blue font (scroll down). | am sure the WSJ will shorten it and
edit it but at least you have an advance copy of it. | just wanted you to have it since the WSJ is read
widely in OC and | don’t want anyone blindsiding you with questions about it.

As you know | have been long proponent of passive antibody therapies in infectious diseases and there
is a huge body of historical data supporting this approach. Certainly, with modern blood banking
techniques this option can be made quite safe and administration of a few cc’s of serum could confer
immediate immunity to those who will be exposed — like ER staff. | hope you agree with the message
and like it.

Thank you for all you are doing for the country and humanity. If you need me for anything in this crisis
rest assured that | am here.

Warm regards,
Arturo

OK, we'll take this and aim to get it out in Friday's paper, though it will likely need some
trimming for space.
