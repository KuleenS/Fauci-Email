Dear Patricia,

Just following up from our phone conversation,
unfortunately | won’t be able to facilitate a

StudioGo truck for this interview.

We are still really keen to get Dr Fauci on the show
— will he be able to come to the bureau?

| will be able to book him a car if he needs.

Let me know what suits,

NIH-002047
