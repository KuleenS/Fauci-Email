The paper you sent me says the experiments were performed before the gain of function pause but have since been
reviewed and approved by NIH. Not sure what that means since Emily is sure that no Coronavirus work has gone
through the P3 framework. She will try to cetermine if we have any distant ties to this work abroad.
