Hi Tony,

| send you greetings and the deepest appreciation.

lam only one of your millions of followers who feel in your debt. But, |am the only one witha
magazine that has dedicated a whole article to "the thirst for Tony Fauci."

This will be the least important item on today's to-do list. But, someday, your grandchildren
and their children, in turn, will want to read

this: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/04/anthony-fauci-coronavirus-

My best wishes to you.

David
