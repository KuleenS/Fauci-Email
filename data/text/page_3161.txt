Coronavirus Lurking in Feces May Reveal Hidden Risk of Spread

(Bloomberg) -- While doctors have focused on respiratory
samples from pneumonia cases to identify coronavirus patients,
they might have ignored a less apparent and hidden source of the
spread: diarrhea.

The novel coronavirus was detected inthe loose stool of

the first U.S. case -- a finding that hasn't featured among case
reports from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak.
However, that doesn’t surprise scientists who have studied
coronaviruses, nor doctors familiar with the bug that caused
SARS.

Diarrhea occurred in about 10-20% of patients afflicted

with severe acute respiratory syndrome about 17 years ago and
was the source of an explosive SARS outbreak in the Amoy Gardens
residential complex in Hong Kong.

SARS and Wuhan viruses bind to the same distinctly shaped
protein receptors in the body that are expressed in the lungs
and intestines, making these organs the primary targets for both
viruses, said Fang Li, an associate professor of veterinary and
biomedical sciences at the University of Minnesota.

fecal material of the 35-year-old man treated at the Providence
