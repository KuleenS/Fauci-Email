Dear Dr Fauci, | enjoyed your recent editorial in JAMA re Coronaviruses

Although the viral disease is not an area of my expertise, you might want to take a look
at a hypothesis we had proposed, long ago (back in the era of SARS), re the potential of
immune-modulating Coronavirus infection natural history with blockage of
aminopeptidase N.

| am not aware of any studies whether aminopeptidase is a receptor of China 2019-
nCoV, though.

sincerely

DPK
