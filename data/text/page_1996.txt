Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir—-ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.
25.0%; difference, -5.8 percentage points; 95% Cl, -17.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with
detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis,
lopinavir—ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that
observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% Cl, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events
were more common in the lopinavir—ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in
the standard-care group. Lopinavir-ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%)
because of adverse events.

Conclusions

In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir—ritonavir
treatment beyond standard care. Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or
exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit. (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and
