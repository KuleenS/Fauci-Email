ONLY covid-19 positive patients requiring hospitalization. This could help prevent transfer of virus to those
hospitalized that do not have the virus and could help reduce the need for more personal protective supplies needed
for staff, since only those staff at that particular hospital would be taking care of those with covid-19. Thank You for
your time.
