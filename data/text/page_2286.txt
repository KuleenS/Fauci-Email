Hello Anthony,
This 1s how the virus was created.

Intervirion Fusion. HIV-luc(ACE2) (500 ng of p24) was mixed with 1,000 ng of p24
of HIV-gfp particles incorporating ASLV-A envelope, SARS-CoV S protein, or
both envelopes in PBS at 4°C for 30 min to allow binding. Samples were raised to
37°C for 15 min to allow for conformational rearrangements. Virions were adjusted
to the desired pH with 0.1 M citric acid. PBS, TPCK-trypsin (final concentration 10
ug/ml), CTSL, cathepsin B (CTSB) (final concentrations 2 p:g/ml) or CTSL buffer
alone was then added. Recombinant CTSL (R &D Systems) was preactivated by
incubation for 15 min at 10 pg/ml in 50 mM Mes, pH 6.0, on ice. Recombinant
CTSB (R &D Systems) was preactivated in 25 mM Mes, 5 mM DTT, pH 5.0, for 30
min at 25°C. After a 10-min incubation at 25°C, proteolysis was halted by the
addition of 300 pl of DMEM 10 containing leupeptin (25 pg/ml) and STI (75 pg/ml).
Virions were then incubated at 37°C for 30 min to allow membrane fusion. 100 ul of
the virion mixture was added in quadruplicate to HeLa-Tva cells pretreated for 1 h
with leupeptin (20 pg/ml). The cells were spin-infected and incubated at 37°C for 5S
h
