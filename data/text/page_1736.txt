Subject: Hello from Canada!

Hi Dr. Fauci,

| thought | would reach out to you amidst this crisis; | respect the work you’re doing a great
deal.) @ Hani El-Gabalawy, did a research sabbatical at NHf (0) (6)

Amazing work that you’re doing. I’ve been following your discussions and scientific
innovation regarding COVID-19. I’ve been working for the federal government in
Intelligence for about thirteen years and recently moved to the Canadian Public Health
Laboratory Network Secretariat to support the Emergency Operations Centre at the
National Microbiology Lab. I’ve been with the NML for almost my whole career.

   

Just a quick hello and deep respect for your work. My colleagues and Director have said
that we’re on the exact same page as you, in terms of your perspective and assessment of
the pandemic. Although there isa border between us, know that we are in agreement with
your work and I’m thrilled to see you advising the public. There is no better person to do
the job.

Kindest regards,
Nadia El-Gabalawy
