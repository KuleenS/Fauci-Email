Cd Salexander tarakhovsky is [ (>) (6) and a professor at rockefeller university. he

is a virologist.

we have been following the corona virus pandemic closely, and a few days ago became alarmed at the
news that the chinese government is sterilizing their paper money from hubei province.

we think that there is a possibility that the virus was released from a lab in wuhan, the
biotech area of china. we also think that the virus might be complexed with another organism, such as a
yeast or fungus, to make it more sticky.

we would like to discuss this with you further. we feel that immediate action must be taken by united
states scientists to try to neutralize this threat.

please contact alexander and me at your earliest convenience at above emails or my mobile

LO) 6 or office) GJ michael lockshin gave me your email.

 

with kind regards
