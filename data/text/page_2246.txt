Dr Fauci,

I know that Dr Kadlec has mentioned the news we heard from genentech about the
evaluation of monoclonal antibodies to IL-6 and IL-6R in severely 111 COVID-19
patients in China.

Additional information became available yesterday and we learned that China
updated Their clinical guidelines to include anti-IL6.

 

Many thanks. I know you are very busy.
Rick
