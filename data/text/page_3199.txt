Subject: thank you for continuing leadership

Dear Dr. Fauci - We met long ago when | was a young health policy staff person at the
Children's Defense Fund and you gave a talk on HIV/AIDS at the annual CDF conference around
1984-86.

When I served on the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) during the 1990-91 measles
epidemic and helped to write the measles whitepaper, | had other occasions to hear your
insights.

Since that time, | have frequently heard you on the PBS NewsHour and NPR, I see your
perspectives in JAMA and other journals. (For example, this week | heard NPR piece and read
JAMA opinion piece on coronavirus.) In every instance, | am struck again by how clearly you
articulate the science, the issues for public concern, and options for our nation's response.

While I've worked with many public health leaders and watched others in the media over the
past 35 years of my Maternal and Child Health public policy career, | believe no one is better at
communications than you. It is in some ways a thankless job. | am writing to say that your
continuing leadership and dedication to our nation's health is deeply appreciated by me and
millions of others.

Best regards, Kay
