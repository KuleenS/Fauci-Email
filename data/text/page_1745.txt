Mortality n COVID-19 patients 1s usually from ARDS (acute
respiratory distress syndrome) via inflammatory cytokines. Apart from
N-acetylcysteine which was found 3 years ago to elevate atrial
natriuretic factor [found by Kiemer in 2001 to zap inflammatory
cytokines: INOS, NF KappaB, and TNFalpha) now piperine in black
pepper was found to inhibit inflammatory cytokines [piperine also
dramatically increases oral bioavailability of turmeric [which has been
used as a potent antiviral]:

BTW the thromboxane hypothesis explains the increased male to female ratio in
infectivity as well as the low incidence in younger people.
