Subject: Mediaset, Italian television broadcast, interview request

Hello Dr. Anthony Fauci,

I'm Alessandro Matarante, an italian reporter, currently working for Mediaset, Italy's most
important television broadcast. Specifically, | work for Quarta Repubblica, a program aired
every Monday in prime-time, leaded by reporter Nicola Porro.

I'm writing this e-mail because it would be a pleasure and an honor for us to interview you
about the coronavirus emergency and the way the United States are facing it.

Clearly, we are available to consider any kind of day and hour to make the interview, and so we
are to consider together the contents of the interview.

Hoping for a positive answer,
| wish you a pleasant day.

Alessandro
