TOKYO

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday advised people
across the country not to go to work or school if they
develop cold-like symptoms, as the country grapples with
the spread of a new coronavirus originating in China.

Workplaces in the country, known for their long hours,
need to encourage people to take days off without
hesitation if they do not feel well, Abe said.

"The first thing that I want the people of Japan to keep in
mind 1s to take time off school or work and refrain from
leaving the house if they develop cold-like symptoms such
as fever," Abe told a meeting of a government task force on
the viral outbreak.

Teleworking is an "effective alternative" to help prevent the
virus from spreading further, Abe said.

He made the remarks as the government is scrambling to
contain the virus that originated in Wuhan, with more
people with no obvious link to China getting infected in
Japan.

The global outbreak of the disease called COVID-19 has
prompted some event organizers in Japan to rethink their
plans for hosting mass gatherings.

The number of confirmed cases in Japan has topped 600,
including over 500 passengers and crew on the Diamond
Princess, a quarantined cruise ship docked at Yokohama
near Tokyo with more than 3,000 confined.

The steady rise in infections in various parts of Japan has
raised public concern, prompting the health ministry to ask
people who develop symptoms such as a temperature of
37.5 C or higher for at least four days to consult local
health care centers and go to designated hospitals. The
period is set shorter for the elderly, those with underlying
conditions and pregnant women.

As Tokyo and other major cities in the country are
notorious for packed rush-hour trains, commuters have
been encouraged by a government panel of medical experts
to go to work earlier or later than usual as the risk of
infection is increased in crowds.
