Please reply to this email by Wednesday, 6 May if you are still available to deliver this important
presentation and, if so, please also include a photo and a brief biography.

We are acutely aware many researchers and research organizations with critical studies and submissions
to HIVR4P are now also heavily engaged in the COVID-19 response. Our hope is that postponing the
conference, rather than presenting it virtually in October, will allow for the broadest participation to foster
knowledge-exchange, debate and direction-setting in the field of HIV prevention research that HIVR4P is
known for.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

HIVR4P - Secretariat

Dear Dr. Fauci,

We are writing with great pleasure to invite you to present at the 4th HIV Research for Prevention
Conference (HIVR4P 2020) in Cape Town, South Africa, from 11-15 October 2020. HIV Research for
Prevention is the only global scientific conference focused exclusively on the challenging and fast-
growing field of HIV prevention research. HIVR4P fosters interdisciplinary knowledge-exchange on
HIV vaccines, microbicides, PrEP, treatment as prevention and biomedical interventions as well as
their related social and behavioural implications.
