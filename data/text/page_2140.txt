Dear Dr. Fauci,

Many years ago, I did some research on the effect of SIV infection on the Macaque
immune response.

I have some thoughts on the current COVID-19 spread and in general about other
virus with unknown cure or immunity vaccine.

In research, we have adhered to a scientific method necessary for the protection of
the public in the development of new technology and treatment. There are times
however when that Boyle method and philosophy should give way to Descartes
approach.

The current infection has thus far shown a predilection for causing severe illness in
men more than women and in adults over 30 sparing children from mortality.

I believe there is a reason for this and it's not because of past exposure to other
coronovirus strains. I believe it is because of children being in the middle of or
having recently completed their immunization schedule for school. These
immunizations are absolutely not providing an immunity to COVID-19, BUT, they
are causing an increase 1n the numbers of gamma delta t cells and NK cells. The
children are responding better to a virus with an 5.1 day median incubation period
because of the higher values of gd and nk cells. Women have a better gd and nk cell
response to the flu and other viral infections which could explain why there is a
gender difference in mortality. | would suggest that adults update their vaccines and
especially the hep b. Interestingly, the hep viruses illicit a better gd and nk cell
response and although most Western countries require hep b for health care workers,
the immunization rate in China is only 60% which may explain the high mortality
among health care providers.
