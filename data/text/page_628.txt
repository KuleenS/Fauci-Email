Subject: COVID 19 Diamond Princess Patients Possible Transmission by Fomites

lam a dermatologist but also a clinical researcher and scientist.
| was reading all of the news regarding concerns and questions on how the fellow patients are being
infected.

A few questions arose, based on the NIH data on SARS Coronavirus, that has been much more studied,
and most likely less virulent than the current COVID 19, which supposedly has HIV traits as well as traits
to increase transmission.

| have wondered if COVID-19 is like Legionella, and possibly transmitted in the airborne water droplets
in the air conditioning units of the Diamond Princess ship.

Even with the SARS Coronavirus, it was shown to be infective on fomites for up to 28 days unless 40
degrees Celsius and 80% humidity, when it was then inactivated in a few hours (see the attached
article). | am wondering if the trays of food, after being passed to passengers on the ships, were then
washed in suboptimal conditions (NOT at 40 degrees Celsium for several hours at 80% humidity)

| AM concerned, that based on the reinfection of those in Wuhan, China, after they returned home, on
whether 14 days of quarantine is enough, based on the modeling and studies on the SARS Coronavirus,
and whether 28 days of quarantine may actually be needed.

With the HIV virus component of COVID 19, one must also wonder if the T cells are being infected and
passing the infection along within an infected patient. In the U.S., we may need to beware of blood
transfusions from anyone infected, even asymptomatically, with COVID 19.

| am sure that you have teams of clinicians and scientists working on this, and | don't know if any of the
original scientists working on the SARS models are still around at Chapel Hill to perform these related
studies and modeling.
