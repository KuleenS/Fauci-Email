Subject: For review by 11 AM Thurs: Sec. Azar coronavirus presser remarks

   

 

 

Hi all,

Attached are draft remarks for the Secretary to deliver tomorrow evening at the scheduled press
conference on coronavirus — after which the plan is for Dr. Redfield and then Dr. Fauci, and then
whoever from State and DHS (I think?) to speak.

Can CDC, NIAID, OGC, FDA, and ASPR let me know if this looks OK by 11 AM tomorrow?

And once CDC and NIAID have their draft TPs, it would be great to see those as well.

Thank you!

- Patrick
