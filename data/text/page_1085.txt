| think Dr. Fauci would want the option of first refusal. He has anticipated he
will be asked about these.

HI Alice — thanks for sending this along. We will confer about how best to
handle media requests about the guidelines — we’re calling them NIH
guidelines and the press release came from NIH, so I’d like to involve the NIH
media office in this, hence I’ve cc’d Renate Myles. | think it’s sort of an
unsettled question as to who the spokespeople will be. Drs. Lane and Masur
— do you have a preference?

Also, who is Claire? (The person who forwarded the CNN request to you and
Dr. Masur. Would be gocd to have a last name so we can confer with her as
needed going forward.)
