Hello Dr. Fauci,

I’m a producer with National Public Radio’s 1A show and we’d like to invite you to
join our program to talk about coronavirus in the near future. We’ve built our show
on answering our 4+ million listeners’ questions and we know Americans have a lot
of questions for you right now. We don’t take live calls, but we do curate input
from voicemails and social media.

We would love to have you jcin us. Please let me know if you are available and
interested anytime soon. Weare very flexible.

A bit more about 1A: We launched in January 2017 and we're ranked among the
top 10 public radio programs on a list that includes Morning Edition, All Things
Considered and Marketplace. We reach 4+ million listeners every week and air on
more than 365 stations across the country. Our major markets include Chicago, LA,
NYC, DC, Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Miami, Houston, Minneapolis
and Seattle.

Best,
Amanda
