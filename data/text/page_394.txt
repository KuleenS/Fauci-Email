at doing a
podcast series
on the
microbiome
(skin, gut,
other
anatomical
bits) and how
it's informing
our views on
health,
disease and
the way we
prevent and
treat
diseases.

It would be
cool to
workshop this
theme with you
and your
colleagues
before my
visit, if you
have some
time?

I cut my teeth
in medical
science
writing on
(bird) flu and
would be
interested in
the research
Jeffrey
Taubenberger's
lab is doing,
but my
understanding
(and I could
be wrong) is
that there's
still a lot of
work to be
done in
producing a
universal flu
