That’s great to hear Elioda and congratulations, many thanks for letting us know. We will certainly get
back to you shortly to enlist your help with the CARI initiative at AU level.

Warm regards,
Trevor

Dear Trevor,

Greetings from Uganda and indeed Africa. It was pleasure meeting you at the Grand Challenges Meeting
in Ethiopia late last year. While there you, Francis Collins and | among others discussed the CARI
Initiative and the need to support research, entrepreneurship and innovation in a big way in Africa. We
also explored the mechanism for CARI Funding. We were also looking for a mechanism to reach the
Committee of Ten (C10) Heads of State and Government championing Education, Science and
Technology in Africa.
