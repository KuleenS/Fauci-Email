I did actually say the quote that is going around, but
the article contained vital context -- we don't know
what proportion are symptomatic. Also we have only
a rough estimate of what proportion of symptomatic
people will have severe outcomes.

Why do I think a pandemic 1s likely? The infection 1s
in many parts of China and many countries in the
world, with meaningful numbers of secondary
transmissions. The scale is much larger than SARS
for example (where the US had many introductions
and no known onward transmission)
