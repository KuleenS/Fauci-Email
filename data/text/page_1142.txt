Thanks for forwarding this very thoughtful document, which presents a series of
important recommendations — most of which | agree with. | don’t know if you saw
Friday’s announcement (attached) of the new public private partnership called

unprecedented speed to prioritize the next set of therapeutic candidates as well as
pushing vaccine development programs to adopt exceptionally creative trial
designs to test safety and efficacy (with full engagement by FDA).

Best regards, Francis

solely by our desire to help defeat the serious threat our nation and the world now faces,
we wrote a set of four actionable, non-partisan proposals (attached) to produce safe and
effective COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines in the shortest possible timeframe, and to
reopen our society ina manner that reduces the risk of future COVID-19 outbreaks.

We hope you find these ideas interesting, and might be willing to share this set of
proposals with Dr. Tony Fauci, a'ong with our willingness to discuss any part of the
