> My name is Adrienne DeLucca and I live in Connecticut. I am a Labor Attorney and represent almost 40,000
public school teachers. You may not read this until months from now as I know you are working tirelessly on the
Coronavirus Task Force. I just felt the need to send you a quick note to thank you. Your expertise and presence
during interviews and White House briefing has offered me so much comfort at such an anxiety ridden time. I have
heard from so many friends and family members who feel the same way about you. Without your involvement we
would be lost as yours is the most credible voice that we have come to rely on. Thank you for all you are doing for
our country. We are all so lucky to have you. I pray that you and your family stay healthy.
