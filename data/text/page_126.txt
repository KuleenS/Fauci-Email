Bob:

Thanks for the note. | hope that all is well with you. Use an N95 if you have them available.
Transmission is similar to influenza: respiratory droplets and likely a bit more as aerosol than
with influenza. People can transmit even when they are asymptomatic. No approved
therapies; however, we are doing clinical trials on ‘re-purposed” drugs such as remdesivir
(Gilead), Vaccine going into phase 1 trial in about 6 weeks, but will not be ready for at least 1.5
years.

Hope that this is helpful.

Best regards,
tony

Thanks for everything you are saying and doing. I’m writing to ask for the latest. Thanks Bob.

What about general care of a patient suspected or confirmed COVID-19. N95 or surgical mask? Any
news on how this disease is being transmitted? Anything new on vaccine or treatment?
