Subject: RE: Inquiry and possible pone call

George:

Thanks for the note. There is a lot of communications between scientists in China and their
colleagues in the USA, many with whom they have been collaborating prior to the outbreak.
There is no real “coordination” of this response since we do not know who is doing what until
we are told — just like you have done here. Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist at WHO is
organizing a meeting on Feb. 11-12 in Geneva to try and develop a research agenda for nCoV. |
am sure that Chinese scientists will be there. It might be helpful to contact her. Her e-mail

address is OCG}

| hope that this is helpful. | will Follow-up with a call.
Best,
Tony
