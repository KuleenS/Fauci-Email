BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai doctors have seen success in treating
severe cases of the new coronavirus with combination of medications for
flu and HIV, with initial results showing vast improvement 48 hours
after applying the treatment, they said on Sunday.

The doctors from Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok said a new approach in
coronavirus treatment had improved the condition of several patients
under their care, including one 70-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan
who tested positive for the coronavirus for 10 days.

The drug treatment includes a mixture of anti-HIV drugs lopinavir and
ritonavir, in combination with flu drug oseltamivir in large doses.

"This 1s not the cure, but the patient's condition has vastly improved.
From testing positive for 10 days under our care, after applying this
combination of medicine the test result became negative within 48
hours," Dr. Kriangska Atipornwanich, a lung specialist at Rajavithi,
told reporters.

"The outlook is good but we still have to do more study to determine
that this can be a standard treatment."

Chinese health officials have already been administering the HIV and flu
drugs to fight the coronavirus. The use of the three together in a cocktail
seemed to improve the treatment, the Thai doctors said.

Another doctor said that a similar approach in two other patients resulted
in one displaying some allergic reaction but the other showed
improvement.

"We have been following international practices, but the doctor
increased the dosage of one of the drugs," said Somsak Akkslim,
director-general of the Medical Services Department, referring to the flu
medicine Oseltamivir.

Thailand has recorded 19 cases of coronavirus. Of the Thai patients,
eight have recovered and gone home while | 1 are still under treatment in
hospitals.
