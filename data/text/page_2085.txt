Subject: March 26th hearing postponed

OMB is putting a hold on sending HHS witnesses to the Hill through the end of March. This
will indefinitely postpone our budget hearing.

Thanks for your patience,
Adrienne

Dear Agency Legislative Affairs Teams:

Due to the full Administration mobilization underway, we are placing a temporary hold on
sending up government witnesses who are engaged in the coronavirus response. The
Executive Branch needs all of its resources directly focused on executing its day-to-day
response to coronavirus. We will continue to practice “radical transparency” with Congress
