Hi Tony:

| hesitate to bother you with this as | am sure that you are inundated with requests of this sort over and
above everything else you are doing which is truly magnificent. | believe that there is something of
potential importance in what is communicated below but you are in the best position to tell me whether
it could fit in the toolbox you are assembling for COVID 19 in both the short and longer term. | have to
acknowledge our friend Bob Gallo for triggering this
