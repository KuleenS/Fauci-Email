Tony,

Thank you for all that you are doing in the fight against COVID-19. Your steady leadership and grounding
in the science, and your ability to communicate complex information clearly to policymakers and the
public, are what the world needs during this crisis. | know we will see the other side of this pandemic,
and you will have once again saved many lives with your work.

lam one step removed from this response, as |am on a detail assignment from FEMA to the Naval
Academy, but have been sharing information with the Superintendent and his senior leadership team so
that they can make good decisions to protect the community while meeting the Academy’s mission. |
have thought back to the H1N1 response in 2009-2010 many times since this began.

Again, thank you for what you’re doing. My best wishes to you and your family.

Best,
Brian
