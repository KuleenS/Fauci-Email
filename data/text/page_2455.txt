Dear Dr Fauci,

Common wisdom tells us that the inability to immunize against HIV, malaria etc. as well
as the need to

repeat evry year anti flu vaccination result from the excessive, or limitless, genetic
variability of the underlying pathogens. While not doubting the reality of this genetic
variability, best observed in an orderly manner in the case of HIV, I considered the
possibility that these pathogens are endowed wiith an immunosuppressive capacity
that is not inactivated during vaccine production, and that current vaccines do not
induce immunity against such

immunosuppression. | applied this reasonning when | worked on an AIDS vaccine in
1991 in Zagury’s lab

(Halbreich A et al. (1992) Vaccine Research,4 :397-412). Indeed, we tested then, in
suitably immunized animals, the effect of the various preparations on the cellular
response to tuberculin and the capacity of animals to be

Immunized against tuberculin and tetanus as a function of the exrent of treatment. The
immune response to these agents was indeed higher in the presence of hivions
compared to heat inactivated préparations. This HIVION preparation was used on 6
patients in Zaire (Zagury et al. (1992) J Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes,

S :676-681).
