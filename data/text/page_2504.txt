CDC/HHS to ensure that properly equipped public health labs (besides CDC’s lab in Atlanta) can
perform real time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) testing for 2019 Novel-Coronavirus (2019-
nCoV).

Our understanding is that given the public health emergency declared by HHS, an emergency use
authorization (EUA) from the FDA is required for public health labs to perform their own lab
developed test for 2019-nCoV, even if it is using the CDC’s published qRT-PCR protocol and
primer/probe sequences (

)
, and the lab is capable of handling BSL3+ samples.

We understand the extreme delicateness of this situation, and also that it is outside of our normal
wheelhouse. But given the concerns of our colleagues in the public health sector, we thought it was
important to give you a heads up regarding this request.

Let us know if there is anyway we can help.
Sincerely,
