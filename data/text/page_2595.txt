Seems to me a big challenge will
be asymptomatic or mild
symptoms in kids, spread through
the schools, shed to parents who
staff both categories acute and
non-acute care clinics. If there are
several days of asymptomatic
shedding, how do you prevent
spread to the vulnerable, high risk
patients in each category?

Will mild symptoms drive
complacent compliance?
