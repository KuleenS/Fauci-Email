collaboration on ACTIV activities?

Hi Francis
We certainly enjoy taking part in ACTIV

| will check if we did get our drugs on the lists below

| will discuss w Kathrin Jansen if we may have an option to add one of our several vaccine formats that
is less advanced or a refined format of our most advanced in the master protocol etc

If we can agree about shared key endpoints , we can include that cross all studies Whether master
protocol or more advanced sponsor trials which helps comparison

Happy to discuss w you and welcome your advice

Hi Mikael,

Thanks for your note and this update on exciting progress on several fronts. ACTIV
is moving forward with gratifying speed and commitment. With regard to vaccines,
tomorrow the ACTIV vaccines WG will be discussing a master protocol for a phase
H/1ll trial with adaptive design, multiple arms, and a shared placebo arm, aiming to
launch on or about July 1. FDA is strongly supportive. The Moderna, Sanofi, and
JnJ vaccines are likely to be included — might Pfizer also join?
