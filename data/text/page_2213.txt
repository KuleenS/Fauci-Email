the potential impact on hospitals. Any person outside of that group
that was severely affected could be identified and

treated. Quarantining otherwise healthy people outside of those
groups who finally demonstrate symptoms--like the NBA players--is
ridiculous. They are likely to get the sniffles and have also already
spread the virus. As long as they're not spreading it to the
endangered group we should not worry about it.

In sum, we need to isolate the vulnerable and realize that the
mortality rate for people outside of that group is likely lower than the
flu.

Of course, while this occurs we are working on finding treatments
and vaccines. But sending home workers who have next to no
likelihood of being significantly impacted by this virus is

ridiculous. The virus hits hardest the old and infirm, two groups that
are most likely NOT to even be in the workforce!

To me, this solution is alot simpler than what is being tried right
now and is much more likely of success. To everyone besides the
endangered group this virus is literally less dangerous than the

flu. There is no reason that anyone outside of the endangered group
should have any concern at all and we need to make that

clear. Please let me know what you think.
