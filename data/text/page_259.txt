Oh, I see what they are getting at. They examined at the single cell level the expression of RNA for ACH2, which
is the receptor for the Coronavirus in the lung ,and found that when they looked at various demographic groups there
was greater expression of this receptor in Asian males. They are thus hinting that this is the reason why there was
such an explosion of infections in China. This is possible, but the lowest level was in Northern Italians and take a
look at what is happening in Northern Italy. 1 do not mean to put the paper down since there may be some truth in
it. However, this journal (bioRxiv) is not peer reviewed and the data are skimpy. Someone should do a more
scholarly study.

They asked if this proved certain ethnic groups more likely to get the discase and I said I had never anything like
that suggested to me by our leading scientists.

Was asked about this on tv tonight.
