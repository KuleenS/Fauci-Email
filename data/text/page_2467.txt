Good Evening Dr Fauci,

I have an idea for your consideration for the Coronavirus vaccine/treatment.

Noting that the virus is attacking our elderly more and knowing their lungs are older
and not as functional to fight this infection. Have you considered artificial surfactant
to boost lung function.

Perhaps if their lungs are stronger to expand they could fight the virus better.
Thank you for listening, My prayers are with our Healthcare Professionals to
achieve a treatment/vaccine.
