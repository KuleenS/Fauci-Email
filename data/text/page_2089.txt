Dear super-star friends:

| wanted to give you a heads up about a letter (attached) that myself as well as two AAAS
Lesher fellows have been working on. Our goal is to send this with as many signatures as
possible to the WH. Most of what we ask for is what you are already doing or going to be
doing but we are calling for enforced social distancing measures, including closing or
severely limiting all non-essential business and schools nationwide. | hope this is useful in
our efforts.

Sincerely,

Carlos del Rio, MD, FIDSA
