Subject: AMA news interview request: What to tell your patients about COVID-19

Dear Dr. Fauci,

My name is Sara Berg and | am a senior writer for the AMA. | am reaching out to you today because you
have shared a lot of great information about COVID-19 with the JAMA network. | know you are very
busy, but | was wondering if you would be available tomorrow or Thursday for a quick phone interview
about what to tell patients who suspect they have COVID-19? This would be an AMA news article for
physicians about what to tell patients. The CDC has a list of preventive steps:

httos://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hc uidance-prevent-spread.html.

This would be what physicians should tell patients who suspect they have COVID-19. One tip might be
“Call before you come in.” Do you think this is something you would be available to participate in?

| look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you,

NIH-001940
