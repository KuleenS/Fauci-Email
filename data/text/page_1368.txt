Hi all,

1. The OpEd is out on the CSIS website: https://www.csis.org/analysis/covid-19-response-corps-
can-help-stop-pandemic It is co-authored by Congresswoman Susan Brooks (R-IN) and
Congressman Ami Bera (D-CA), members of the CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s
Health Security. Thanks very much to Steve Morrison for making this happen.

2. Here’s the link to the press release on the 40-member letter to FEMA, Peace Corps, and CNCS
from Senator Van Hollen:

b. Includes link to letter:

vanhollen.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Peace%20Corps%20covid19%20service%20oppor
tunties%20letter%2004.02.20.pdf

With this new, bipartisan OpEd, it’s time to reach out to national, state and local authorities and
opinion leaders to encourage implementation and create demand. Suggestions from one of us: NGA
and individual governors. Republicans who will be most interested and helpful are Baker (MA), DeWine
(OH) anc Hogan (MD). Democrats: Cuomo, Pritzker, Newsom, Whitmer, Inslee. AMA, ASTHO, APHA all
good potential champions.

Please also amplify on social media.
Updates and suggestions welcome as always.
