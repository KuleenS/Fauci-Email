| ask because not only have many Asian people now encountered increased racism in public places
(due to fear that any Asian person is a source of COVID-19), but now that the President is turning this
epidemic into additional fear-mongering about "borders" it seems all the more important that scientists do
not inadvertently add to “xenophobia” (even though non-white skin does not mean a person is foreign)
and do not seem to advance any political perspective.

Sincerely and with best personal regards,
