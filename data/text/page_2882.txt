Good morning.
I'd like to follow up on yesterday’s inquiry from our reporter Neal.

If Dr. Fauci is available to address the concerns of this cruise ship in Japan
with Corona virus (re: air circulation system) today, we’d love him to have
him on.

Unfortunately, the first available interview time is after 11 a.m.

If it works, please let me know. This time, we'd like to record an interview to
be used for air so we have some flexibility.

Thank you!
