GILEAD SCIENCES STATEMENT ON POSITIVE DATA EMERGING
FROM NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS
DISEASES’ STUDY OF REMDESIVIR

Foster City, Calif., April 29, 2020 — Gilead Sciences. Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) is aware
of the positive data emerging from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases’ (NIAID) study of remdesivir. We understand that the trial has met its
primary endpoint and that NIAID will provide detailed information at an upcoming
briefing.

In addition to the NIAID trial, Gilead expects to share additional remdesivir data
from the company’s open-label Phase 3 SIMPLE trial in patients with severe COVID-
19 disease shortly. This study will provide information on whether a shorter, 5-day
duration of therapy may have similar efficacy and safety as the 10-day treatment
course evaluated in the NIAID trial and other ongoing trials. Gilead expects data at
the end of May from the second SIMPLE study evaluating the 5- and 10-day dosing
durations of remdesivir in patients with moderate COVID-19 disease.
