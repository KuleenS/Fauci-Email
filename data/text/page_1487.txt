intervene, you’re essentially cured,” he told Ushma Neill, the editor

of The Journal of Clinical Investigation, in 2014. “Now, that seems a
little bit too simplistic, but that’s really the nature of most infectious
diseases.”

Working in the lab of Sheldon Wolff, Fauci studied the molecular nature
of fever. The field of immunology was still young, but scientists were
rapidly learning how to manipulate the smallest components of
individual cells, which opened the way to a decade of discovery.
Chronic fevers can have a number of underlying causes, among them an
uncommon condition known as vasculitis—an inflammation of the
blood cells that often occurs when the body’s immune system
mistakenly attacks its own blood vessels. Many of Fauci’s vasculitis
patients suffered from rare inflammatory diseases, such as
granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which damages blood vessels in the
lungs, kidneys, and other organs. The disease was almost always fatal.
Fauci and his infectious-disease colleagues at the N.I.H. were frequently
asked to visit the National Cancer Institute, which was in the same
building as his lab, to consult on patients who were receiving
chemotherapy. The drugs suppressed tumors, but they were highly toxic.
And they had another side effect, Fauci told me: “Those people are
susceptible to a lot of things like infections and bleeding, because the
treatment has destroyed their immune systems.”
