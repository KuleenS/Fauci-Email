Interesting to see how they view outbreaks.....

Coronavirus news over the weekend was a small net positive (although there were
plenty of negatives). Encouragingly, doctors appear to be having some success
treating patients with existing antiviral drugs — GILD’s remdesivir improved the
clinical conditions of a coronavirus patient in Washington state (WSJ) while
Thailand said it had achieved good results using antiviral drugs originally designed
for the flu and HIV (Bloomberg). It’s way too early to tell whether these drugs will
perform well in other patients (and a vaccine is still some time away), but the
progress noted in the US and Thailand 1s positive. The PBOC said it would inject
CNY 1.2T worth of liquidity on Monday 2/3 to ensure markets operate smoothly
when they reopen from the New Year holiday (this works out to about CNY150B of
net incremental liquidity given CNY 1.05T of reverse reports are set to mature on
Monday). The gov’t also announced other steps (including waiving equity
ownership limits for some insurers) aimed to bolstering market confidence. The
global coronavirus case count continues to rise (it now stands at ~15K as of Sunday
morning w/the death toll north of 300) while more travel restrictions are being
imposed by governments and companies around the world (Apple said it would
shutter all its stores and offices in China until Feb 9). According to a CNBC update,
areas of China responsible for ~80% of GDP and ~90% of exports are set to stay
Closed until at least Feb 10.
