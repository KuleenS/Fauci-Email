But | did say to Maria, Doctor Maria Degioanni, "Maria, | want to invite Dr. Fauci to come and visit us for
a few days when this crisis is over, God willing and maybe he would come together with

. who has promised to come and visit again after 20 years. We can put them
up in the fancy Relais San Damian above Isolalunga where | live and take them out to dinner at Gente di
Mare. Dear Doctor Fauci, | like to joke when people ask how we are doing in this time of Covid-19 by
saying : A Name, a guarantee: ISOLAlunga= ISOLAtion! Legend says that the Benedictine monks who got
into mischief centuries ago were sent here as punishment to work in the olive groves: long isolation.
Today it's the perfect place to be with a view of the Mediterranean as well as the Maritime Alps from
the kitchen window and hardly a soul to practice social distancing with!
Grazie per esistere as an Italian song goes, "thank you for being you! | would adore getting a reply from
you, but realize how miraculous that woud! be! We would be over the moon if you accepted our
invitation, at any time and at the drop of a hat!

Sincerely, Rita Apgar
