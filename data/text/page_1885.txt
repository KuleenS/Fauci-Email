to brainstorm together, led by NIAID, and seek to identify any additional areas of
contribution that could be subject to acceleration and/or collaboration.

Hilary Marston recently convened a Deputies meeting on this subject, and ICs were then
asked to submit examples last Friday of projects they are pursuing in the COVID-19
space. Those were forwarded from Bob Eisinger to me. | have used those submissions,
including a detailed list of NIAID projects, to put together a tentative agenda for
Wednesday’s meeting. That is attached.

There are admittedly a lot of themes and topics here, so this will require some real
discipline in the one-slide presentations. | will try to serve as time-keeper— or maybe I'll
ask Larry to do that. | | |

All IC Directors are invited to have one or two subject matter experts join them for this
virtual discussion.

Ashley Parkerf (0) 4} will be helping me with the logistics and will have

further instructions about how the log in will work.

Here’s the specific follow up request that needs your immediate attention:
1. If your IC is pursuing a highly relevant project that’s not listed here, and that you
want the group to hear about, please send me that information ASAP.
2. If your IC is on the draft agenda to make a presentation, please submit your one
slide (except for NIAID, who gets more) to me and Ashley by COB Tuesday
3/24. That way we can put the whole set together as a single ppt file.

Many thanks! This should provide a welcome respite from the many other tasks we are all
facing right now.
