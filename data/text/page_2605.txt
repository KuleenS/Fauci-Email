WHO estimates 80% of patient
with COVID-19 have mild disease
and recover; that implies that 20%
have severe disease. WHO
estimated that 14% develop
pneumonia and 5% are considered
critical. [We were estimating that
12% of cases needed
hospitalization (so 88% did not)
and 2% needed ICU care (with
mortality of patients with
pneumonia tn the ICU generally
between 15%-50% so a CFR of
0,3%-1.0%). Also noet his
comment on sparing children. The
latter comments are reminiscent of
the early comments of public
health leaders during the 1918
pandemic—always minimizing. I
have no idea where an attack rate
of 4 per 100,000 comes from. |

GENEVA: The new novel
coronavirus only causes mild
disease for 80 per cent of infected
patients, said the World Health
Organization on Monday (Feb
17). Speaking to reporters, WHO
chief Tedros Adhanom
Ghebreyesus said that 14 per cent
of patients would have severe
diseases such as pneumonia.

"Around five percent of cases are
considered critical with possible
multi-organ failure, septic shock
and respiratory failure and, in
some cases, death," he added.
