Mark:

Thanks for the note. If we startin April ( ~6-7 weeks from now) with a phase 1
trial of 45 subjects, it will take another 3-4 months to determine safety and some
immunogenicity. The next step is phase 2 for efficacy. We may need help with
resources for the phase 2 trial if we do not get our requested budget
supplement. | believe that we will be OK. If this goes off track, | will contact
you. Many thanks for the offer. Much appreciated.

Best regards,

Tony

Tony:
| was glad to hear your statement that the covid-19 vaccine will be ready for human trials in six weeks.
Are there any resources our foundation can help provide to potentially accelerate this or at least make

sure it stays on track?
