Tony,

Many thanks for taking the time to respond. Please let me know if | can help in any way.

Our mobile device app (developed with Apple) has been quite helpful and is growing in use (over 10K) as
a screening, referral and surveillance tool for several user sets.

Just one of the many areas we continue to develop.

Best wishes

jeff
