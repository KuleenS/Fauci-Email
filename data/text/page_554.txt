Now that I've had a chance to read the whole story -- after editors finished whirling -- | see it also
contains these grafs:

Are they accurate?

Thanks

During one call, the CDC’s principal deputy director, Anne Schuchat, argued against
taking the infected Americans on the plane, according to two participants. She noted the
U.S. government had already told passengers they would not be evacuated with anyone
who was infected or showed symptoms. She was also concerned about infection control.
Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who
was also on the calls, recalled saying her points were valid and should be considered.
But Robert Kadlec, assistant secretary for preparedness and response for the
Department of Health and Human Services and a member of the coronavirus task force,
pushed back: Officials had already prepared the plane to handle passengers who might
develop symptoms on the long flight, he argued. The two Boeing 747s had 18 seats
cordoned off with 10-foot-high plastic on all four sides. Infectious disease doctors would
also be onboard.

Hi, Tony:
The Washington Post has just put up a story saying that the 14 infected passengers on the buses
containing 238 American passengers from the Diamond Princess were flown home AGAINST the

CDC's advice. And that the States Department overruled the CDC on this.

Can you confirm whether that's true?
