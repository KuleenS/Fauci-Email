Tony,

As you are acutely aware, the COVID-19 situation is on everyone’s mind and accordingly there have
been questions raised by members of the AAAAI about what the organization can do to provide more
guidance in this evolving situation. In light of this linked to the fact that our annual meeting begins
March 13 in Philadelphia, we have made the decision to have a 45-60 minute session in the main hall on
Saturday (March 14) morning from 7:00-8:00 prior to the scheduled plenary session slated to start at
8:15. My question is whether you would consider taking the Acela up Friday evening returning Saturday
morning to host this session with a presentation followed by a Q&A session. If that is not possible,
would you be willing to provide a 10-15 minute (shorter if you deem that appropriate) video generated

as close to the 14" as possible that we would have projected in the main hall as noted above. If the
latter, would you have a suggestion of an ID person in Philadelphia who would be knowledgeable and
could field questions following your video. | recognize that even if you are willing to come to
Philadelphia, that circumstances could arise that would preclude your traveling in which case we would
ask for a video if at all possible. Finally, if neither option is possible, is there somebody in DC (including
NIH), Baltimore or Philadelphia who could provide the short review and then sit for 30-45 minutes of
Q&A. | am well aware that this is last minute and you have been incredibly busy with issues related to
the pandemic, any help you could provide would be much appreciated by my colleagues and me.
Regards,

Tom
