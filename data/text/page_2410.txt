Dear Tony

A note to let you know how much over the years | have appreciated your
active support of biologic research, public health and your directorship of
NIAID. Impressive, intelligent, high integrity and management skills has
placed you at the head of the curve. | reached this conclusion from
personal observations of your work and style as well as having served as a
consultant for NIAID and several other NIH Institutions, WHO, Pasteur and
Karolinska.

After nearly 50 years of continuous research from my original Al09484
grant studying viral pathogenesis[ acute and persistent infections] using the
LCMV model, | decided to close my laboratory. | have had other generous
NIH support as well especially for investigations of other negative strand
viruses[ primarily measles and influenza, Lassa ,arenavirus receptor],
Ebola, cytokine storm and autoimmunity. The Al09484 grant was credited
by 300 peer reviewed papers, training of 61 postdoctoral fellows[ including
Rafi Anmed, Christine Biron, Persephone Borrow, Ray Welsh, lan Lipkin,
Dorian McGavern and other successes including the late Patrick Sissons
who was the Reagent Professor of Medicine at Cambridge. Over 85% of
these folk are in academic medicine/biology at research institutes or
universities.

Good luck and smooth sailing with the current coronavirus pandemic. With
your involvement this work Is in good hands.

Best wishes
Michael
