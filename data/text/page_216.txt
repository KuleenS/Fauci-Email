Subject: Lack of preparedness for the coronavirus pandemic

Importance: High

Dear Dr. Collins and Dr. Fauci,

| am sorry to say that our lack of preparedness for the coronavirus pandemic has
its roots in the way biomedical research is funded in the United States, as well as
in the lack of leadership and vision on the part of NIH and its institutes since the
SARS coronavirus outbreak in 2003. | try to expand on these problems in the
article below. | would welcome your response to my thesis.

Sincerely,

Nejat Diizgiines, Ph.D.
