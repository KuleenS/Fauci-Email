Subject: Covid-19. thromboxane inhibitors, and heme binding (O2 desaturation)

I have a suggestion for 3 potent antiviral agents, cheap and readily available, that
may prevent viral shedding. No viral shedding? No infectivity. The concept is that
EVERYONE should take these items. Two of the items also positively affect heme
binding. Covid-19 binds to heme causing O2 desaturation, lung failure and death.

First a short bio:

Dr. Josh Backon was affiliated with the Hebrew University Faculty of Medicine
for over 33 years. He has a good track record (84+ publications quoted by over 750
other researchers

In the 1980's he was Consulting Editor of the Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology,
Editor of Reviews in Pure and Applied Pharmacological Sciences, and Associate
Editor of the International Joumal of Adolescent Medicine and Health. From 1990-
2004, he was a consultant on emergency planning and management at Israel’s
National Police Headquarters with Nitzav Mishneh Danny Fisher.

 
     

Chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, is now being used to treat Covid-19. Its
mechanism was found in the 1970’s to inhibit thromboxane

oxaneé&ebtnG= The problem with chloroquine was that it also elevated levels of
prostaglandin F2alpha. In 1980, Srivastava, an Indian biochemist working in
Denmark found that GINGER is a potent inhibitor of thromboxane synthetase. I
wrote a number of papers tn the 1980’s on use of ginger:
