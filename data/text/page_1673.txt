Hi Mr. Secretary,

Just wanted to let you know — we had a very productive and significant two-hour virtual meeting with
leaders of industry, FDA, and NIH yesterday. | attach the bios of those who attended — which includes
the heads of R&D of nine major pharmaceutical companies. There is unanimous support for bringing
together all of the sectors to accelerate development of therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19. Tony
compared this to what happened in the early 1990s that led to successful antivirals for HIV.

| attach the action items that came out of this meeting. Working groups for each of the four main topics
will be rapidly organized. | will keep you posted.

Best, Francis
