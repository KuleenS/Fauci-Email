Subject: Question on report Dr. Fauci told he cannot speak with media unless cleared by White House

 

Good Day: Could you please comment on this report from the New York Times that Dr. Fauci
has been told that he must clear anything he plans to say about the coronavirus outbreak with
the White House before he speaks to any media?
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/us/politics/us-coronavirus-pence.html

"Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, one of the country’s leading experts on viruses and the director of the
National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases, told associates that the White House had
instructed him not to say anything else without clearance.”

Has Dr. Fauci or any other NIH official been told by the White House they cannot speak to the
media unless cleared by the White House?

Please do let me know.

Thank you for your help.
