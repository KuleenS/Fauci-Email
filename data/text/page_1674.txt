Dear Tony,

In these unsettlirg times, you are a much-appreciated voice of reason and
proponent of rational science.
A great credit to NIH and NIAID...we’re all very proud of you.

| know that you have long advocated preparation of viral vaccines against
future pandemic threats.
I’m sure that it has been difficult to convince pharmas, charitable agencies
and even the government to fund these efforts.
which would include vaccine production and storage for indefinite periods.
Perhaps there will be a greater willingness to
revisit a cost-benefit analysis of this effort in the near future.

| would be happy to serve on committees, study sections etc. in an effort to
increase our ability to identify and fund first-rate

Immunology research that might accelerate innovative, safe and effective
approaches to improved viral vaccines going forward.

All very best regards, h.
