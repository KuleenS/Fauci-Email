areas. I would anticipate that the
tripwire for implementing NPIs
(community transmission), will
also be the trigger for healthcare
systems to dial down or turn off
elective admissions (primarily
surgical) to free up acute care and
ICU/monitored meds. The most
effective way to protect these non-
acute areas is by shunting
potential COVID patients away
from these areas and either
providing this type of care while
the patients is hospitalized in acute
care or thru telephone care/home
care for patients with mild illness
receiving care at home. And the
most effective way to shunt these
patients away from non-acute care
areas is thru the implementation of
early and aggressive NPIs of
isolation of the ill and home
quarantine of household contacts
(and not fit testing the world and
passing out PPE that we don’t
have).
