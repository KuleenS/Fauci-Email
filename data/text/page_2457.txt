Good morning Dr Fauci

We are - for the moment - scheduled for a Unitheads meeting on Tuesday. Tae Wook is next to
present but suggested (see below) that we make it a round table and discuss COVID-19.

Question: IF Unitheads isn’t canceled how do you feel about having a Roundtable instead of Tae
Wook presenting? Or would you prefer to take a break from Coronavirus for a moment and
hear about HIV!

Thanks
Jen
