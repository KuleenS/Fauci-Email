We know that this is terribly last minute, but the CRO! Chairs and Foundation are hoping
you are free to give the NIAID/NIH update. CROI is in Boston, March 8 to 11.

If you think you would be able to do this, we will send a more formal communication with
details and work with Patty on the specifics. Thank you so much Dr Fauci; we hope you will
be able to join us.

Best,
Donna
