Zeke:
| did not “strongly” endorse it. | specifically said that it was not a knockout drug
and was only a baby step in the direction of developing more and better drugs. |
said that it was important because it proved in a well-powered, randomized,
placebo-controlled clinical trial that one can suppress the virus enough to see a
clinical effect, as modest as the effect was. | do not think | forced anything.
Happy to chat with you about it.
Best,

Tony,

| hope you and[__©®) ©) are doing well. You are doing an amazing job under difficult
circumstances. And just know we prefer the "real" Tony to the Brad Pitt version!!!

lam a bit perplexed by your seeming strong endorsement of remdesivir. Was it just a bit
forced?

My reading was the data were weak and in normal times for normal disease it is not enough to
to approve. And very unlikely to really impact COVID-19 disease pattern--regardless of supply

issues.

Stay safe
