The dramatic announcement by Dr Anthony Fauci in the Oval Office on Wednesday prompted concerns
among scientists that the Trump administration was raising hopes about a coronavirus treatment before
sharing the full data with researchers.

As a cautionary example of inflating the potential value of a therapy, some pointed to President Donald
Trump’s repeated endorsements of malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment, with no evidence
that it works.

Newer data suggests the malaria treatments may carry significant risks for some sufferers of the
respiratory disease caused by the virus.

Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is running the
trial, said he took the first opportunity to get the word out that patients taking a dummy treatment or
placebo should be switched to remdesivir in hopes of benefiting from it.

He expressed concern that leaks of partial information would lead to confusion. Since the White House
was not planning a daily virus briefing, Fauci said he was invited to release the news at a news
conference with Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards(D). “It was purely driven by ethical concerns,” Fauci
told Reuters in a telephone interview.

“| would love to wait to present it at a scientific meeting, but it’s just not in the cards when you have a
situation where the ethical concern about getting the drug to people on placebo dominates the
conversation.”

An independent data safety and monitoring board, which had looked at the preliminary results of the
NIAID trial, determined it had met its primary goal of reducing hospital stays.
