Zeke:
| did not “strongly” endorse it. | specifically said that it was not a knockout drug
and was only a baby step in the direction of developing more and better drugs. |
Said that it was important because it proved in a well-powered, randomized,
placebo-controlled clinical trial that one can suppress the virus enough to see a
Clinical effect, as modest as the effect was. | do not think | forced anything.
Happy to chat with you about it.
Best,
