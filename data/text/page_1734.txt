David:

| know that itis you. | amsorry, but | am getting more than 2000 e-mails pe day. | totally
agree with you and this issue is being actively discussed as recently as today at the task Force
meeting. | am not sure what you mean by aerial “eradication” procedures that could be
practically implemented. There are some data from NIH that indicate that mere speaking
without coughing elicits aerosols that travel a foot or two. If that is the case, then perhaps
universal wearing of masks in the most practical way to go.
Best regards,
Tony

For God's sake, Tony -- this is me, not simply an unknown
"messenger" from the general public! We go back together
for many, many years (to our days together at the NIH,
remember?). As you may recall, we worked (successfully)
during the infamous 1969 "March on Washington", among

other historically important events.
Although Iam nowt 9 I continue to pay careful

attention to world events, and this is one that exceeds any
others that have occurred in our lifetime!

As I wrote in my previous e-mail, I have become convinced that COVID-19 is
behaving as an airborne virus, and, therefore, we should be directing our
mitigation efforts toward more comprehensive aerial eradication

procedures!

Think about the most recent reports -- namely that imprisoned inmates, and
a young baby, have recently been reported as "infected" with this virus.
