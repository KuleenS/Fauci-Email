(homes, offices/workplaces,
schools, daycare, etc., 1s
unchanged). For additional
background and context, we
attached are 3 papers on NPIs and
TLC for those who are interested.
Richard Hatchett deserves full
credit for birthing the idea of TLC
(it was actually developed in
response to the threat of HSN1 and
later adopted for pandemic
influenza response). Duane,
perhaps you can store these
documents on MAX for safe
keeping and access?

The first paper is an historical
review of the 1918 pandemic (the
comparison of Philadelphia and
St. Louis is emblematic of the
lesson from 1918 that timing
matters when deploying NPIs—
need to be early). The second
paper is modeling work that was
done to evaluate these strategies.
At the time, modelers were
focused on how best to contain an
outbreak overseas (really focusing
on using antivirals primarily for
treatment and prophylaxis). They
focused their models to evaluate
the effectiveness of various
strategies and quantities of
antiviral medications required to
quench an emerging outbreak.
There were 3 groups who were
doing this work back then. They
each present their data in that
paper. A few things to note. In all
the model runs, they did not model
perfection or 100% adherence
(actually far from it). You will see
scenarios from 30/60 (meaning
30% compliance and 60%
ascertainment) on up to 90/80 ).
