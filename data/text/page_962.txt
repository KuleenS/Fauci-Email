not be limited to OPV, as other live vaccines have also been associated with non-
specific protective effects (such as BCG vaccine against tuberculosis). Nonlive
vaccines in contrast do not seem to have the same effects.

The exact mechanism of non-specific protection induced by live vaccines needs to
be elucidated further. Clinical studies could begin immediately because the
vaccines in question are licensed and have an excellent safety record. Clinical trials
involving off-label use of various drugs licensed for other indications are currently
underway. The existing scientific rationale suggests that the same should be done
for OPV and other live vaccines. A study is currently being discussed with various
partners and vaccine manufacturers, including the US FDA, the outcomes of which
will be carefully assessed to determine potential use in the context of the spread of
SARS-CoV2 until the time when specific vaccines and antiviral therapies are ready.

Dr Gallo thank you for your note and | appreciate you reaching out to me. | have copied Dr
Collins and Dr Tabak to consider the ACTIV forum they have created to bring industry
academia and government to consider scientific base approaches That you have
described. Dr Collins has organized a vaccine group and | assess could be the best and
fastest place to discuss your concept. | am sure they will connect with you soonest
