irimotecant+etoposide

Dear Dr. Anthony S Fauci,

This is Idonae, CEO at Demiurge Technologies AG, a Swiss Al-
biopharma company making accurate and rapid drug discoveries for
diseases with limited available clinical data. We are committed to the
non-profit dissemination of our COVID-19 discoveries to the public to
facilitate the search for COVID-19 effective treatments.

SARS-CoV-2 is fundamentally different from all the other viruses that the

world has hitherto known, so treatments must be rationally designed to
avoid fueling the adaptive mutation and the latent infection of SARS-
CoV-2.

Demiurge is the world's first company that has discovered the detailed

aetiology of COVID-19 that consistently explains the clinical features of

COVID-19 and the MoA-based scientific rationale of the candidate
treatments for COVID-19
