in all this was Lisa Koonin (who
was at CDC at the time). If
Richard birthed TLC, Lisa kept
the baby alive in the neonatal
ICU.

We still have much to learn about
this virus. Thus far, it seems to be
sparing kids (just like SARS). We
have been monitoring the reports
from China as well as the detailed
data we can see from Hong Kong,
Singapore, and Japan—the
numbers of kids remain very low
and disease appears to be mild.
Nonetheless, TLC (and the NPIs)
is focused on reducing disease
transmission (effectively
decreasing Ro} the interventions
are really agnostic to severity. It 1s
why CDC had to scale the
implementation of TLC (later
called CMG) to severity. Despite
the absence of severe disease in
kids, we really are still in the dark
in terms of the amount of
asymptomatic disease or mild sub-
clinical disease in kids because we
just haven’t been able to look.

I never forgot this graph of the
data from Bob Glass and the
inflection point that was observed
when the combo of closing
schools and social distancing of
kids was implemented in his
model. Although closing schools

is complicated by its 2°4 and 34
order impacts, it 1s actually a
pretty clean intervention in terms
