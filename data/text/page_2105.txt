Question: Is the implication that the virus would have stopped spreading
rapidly in China even if their government had not instituted drastic measures
to curtail the epidemic?

Put another way: Is it not correct that the drastic measures implemented by
the Chinese government were very helpful in halting the spread of the virus in
China?

From yet another angle: Is it correct that the public health measures adopted in
South Korea and Taiwan have proved very effective in controlling the spread of the

epidemic?

Thank you very much again for your hard work,
