In looking at NEJM, they have had 4 COIVD-19 perspectives in last 6 weeks, and they may have impacted
their thinking.

Agree with talking to editors. If interest in Science or Nature, suggestions below.
Priscilla Kelly, editor at science emailec me a while about their interest in papers. So if interest in
Science, we could check with her.

lf Nature, Ursula Weiss.

You and Tony decide. Science or Nature accomplish the same but it seems we need a discussion with
the editor first to explain the importance of the manuscript.
