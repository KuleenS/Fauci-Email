Why do I think 40-70% infected?
Simple math models with oversimple
assumptions would predict far more
than that given the RO estimates in the
2-3 range (80-90%). Making more
realistic assumptions about mixing,
perhaps a little help from seasonality,
brings the numbers down

pandemic flu in 1968 was estimated to
_symptomatically_ infect 40% of the
population, and in 1918 30%. Those
likely had RO less than COVID-19.

What could make this scenario not
happen? 1) conditions in Wuhan could
be so different in some fundamental
way from elsewhere that we are
mistaken in expecting further
outbreaks to have basic aspects in
common. No reason I know of to
think that but a formal possibility
