charge of testing in a large medical system in Rochester, New York,
who has been extremely concerned and frustrated by the lack of access
to reagents for the Roche coronavirus testing platform. They have the
platform but cannot use it because of a lack of reagents (which were
apparently pre-purchased by Quest, LabCorp, and other national
groups). The turnaround time for Quest is approximately 5 days and
this is completely useless for making clinical decisions about admission
compared with local testing with 24 hour per around time.

Thank you for your attention and for everything that you are doing to
help our country through this great challenge.

Best, Jeremy

P.S. | enjoyed the interview with you in Science and admire your clarity
of purpose.
