WHO experts have also been on an investigative mission in China this week, holding meetings in Beijing
and traveling to the provinces of Sichuan and Guangdong. But they had not been scheduled to travel to
Wuhan, where the outbreak began at a live animal market and which remains under strict lockdown in
an effort to contain the virus.

This had led to speculation that the Chinese government, which has come under fire for its slow
response to the outbreak and where medical workers are stretched to the limit, did not want the
experts to visit.

But the WHO said late Friday that the experts would be traveling to the center of the outbreak on
Saturday, although they gave no further information about their itinerary.

Kim reported from Seoul and Denyer from Tokyo. Lyric Li in Beijing, Akiko Kashiwagi in Tokyo and Chico
Harlan and Stefano Pitrelli in Rome contributed reporting.
