A ais

The author of our case-series - proof today will send to you - is an ICU doc in Wuhan - trained with Derek Angus -
he has been great - but I have asked him about himself, his family - we loss track of the personal - which is so
important.

I have had a few "emergencies" like this - at BCH - with Jerry Klein - some infectious disease outbreaks; a couple
major car accidents; etc. Also worked at the Berhorst Clinic in Guatemala in 1978 (before there was global health)
numerous 5-10-15 people emergencies - always end though - for you this is the pandemic that never stops giving.

Try to take a break; have a good glass of Claret on me.

Howard:

Your outline looks fine. Am hanging in there. Feels like my internship and first year residency when I was on
every other night and every other weekend, but actually never left the hospital because the patients were so sick.
Best,

Tony
