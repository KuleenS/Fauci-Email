Naomi:

lam not aware of any efforts on rationing ventilators. They speak of making
sure the high priority areas such as NYC get what they need, but there is no talk at
this time of “rationing”
Thanks,

Subject: vent rationing

Hi Tony-
| know you are very busy but | wanted to see if you know of any effort on the part of the federal
government to issue guidance on the rationing of ventilators when the time comes? Many of my
colleagues in critical care across the country have been asking for some such guidance on a federal level.
Both for the guidance itself and to protect themselves from legal liability. Are you aware of any such
efforts? Thanks for any insights on this. And thanks for all you are doing on the coronavirus effort!

Best regards,

Naomi
