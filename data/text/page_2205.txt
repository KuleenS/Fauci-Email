EMAIL

 

 

I APOLOGISE FOR SOME TYPOS IN MY PREVIOUS EMAIL SENT TO YOU

OUT OF SPONTANEOUS ENTHUSIASM. PLEASE CONSIDER THIS CORRECTED
VERSION INSTED.

Dear Dr. Fauci,

You may not remember but we have met years back when I| was at Stanford University and Training
with the late Donald E Thomas to consider cell therapy of HIV based on the use of reduced intensity,
non-myeloablative conditioning in preparation for stem cell transplantation to induce tolerance and
then apply cell therapy with donor lymphocytes which | have proposed for consideration of treatment
of patients with HIV with secondary nalignancy.

The purpose of this email is to try and capture your attention in order to
consider a new treatment option for COVID-19 that can be applied for
patients in need with evidence of disease with no delay. Whereas many
companies focus on development of anti-corona vaccine, | believe the more
rational approach should be to develop treatment for COVID-19 and then, if
the virus will be deleted and/or the disease controlled or

modified, vaccination will result without the need for specific corona-specific
vaccination which is not yet available and by the time it may be available it
may no longer be relevant.

| am serving as the Medical Director of a company in Hungary and we
believe that one simple and safe experimental treatment of patients with
existing viral disease may already be at hand, -
