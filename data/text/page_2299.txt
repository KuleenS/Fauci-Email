Subject: Coronavirus test
Dear Tony:

If you can find a few minutes, | would very much like to talk with you briefly about a new diagnostic
LAMP test for coronavirus COVID-19 that we have developed here at NEB. | attach a paper now in the
MedRxiv that briefly describes the test. It has been used already in Wuhan and because of its simplicity,
speed and visual output we think it would be very useful for use here in the US. We have just met with
several people at Mass General Hospital and will be working with them for local validation here in MA.
The test itself is very inexpensive, does not require any special equipment nor training of technicians.
This would appear ideal for the FDA and the CDC to know about, but I have not so far been able to reach

NIH-000716
