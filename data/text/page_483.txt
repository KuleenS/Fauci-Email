Dear Dr. Fauci,

Thank you very much for speaking to us at the 43rd Annual KAMA Convention. It was a
tremendous privilege for all of us. You were also so kind to stay afterwards to take pictures
with all those who asked.

To be honest, having you there was very surreal. You symbolize the best of American
medicine. | grew up idolizing your accomplishments as college and medical student. You

saved and touched the lives of so many around the world. It is still hard to believe that |
had this special opportunity to welcome you.

We will continue to do our best to serve the public and mentor medical students. | hope
you Can speak to us again in the near future. Thank you very much. | hope you continue in
your position for another 40 years.

Warmest regards,

John H. Won
