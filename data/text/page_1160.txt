DOCTOR FAUCI, I KNOW YOUR DAYS ARE FILLED WITH OFFERING ADVICE AND COUNSEL TO SO MANY
PEOPLE ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS. WITH THE SOBERING POSITION WE HAVE BEEN IN FOR A WHILE, WHAT
WOULD BE YOUR MOST URGENT MESSAGE TO AMERICANS?

THE PHRASE ‘FLATTENING THE CURVE’ HAS BECOME COMMONPLACE IN OUR VERNACULAR IN RECENT
WEEKS. HOW MUCH CLOSER ARE WE GETTING TO FLATTENING THE CURVE?

YOU'VE SAID SEVERAL TIMES THAT THE VIRUS IS THE CLOCK. WHAT IS THE VIRUS TELLING YOU ABOUT
THAT TIME FRAME?

AS THE COUNTRY TRIES TO WORK ITS WAY BACK, THERE HAS BEEN SPECULATION ABOUT HOW
PROFESSIONAL SPORTS CAN RETURN. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW, FOR INSTANCE, MAJOR LEAGUE
BASEBALL WOULD BE ABLE TO START ITS SEASON?

BASEBALL IS A SPORT IN WHICH SHAKING HANDS IS AS COMMON AS BALLS AND STRIKES. NOT JUST IN
BASEBALL, OBVIOUSLY, BUT IN LIFE OVERALL, HOW MUCH DO YOU ADVOCATE NOT SHAKING HANDS
ANYMORE?

THE NEW YORK TIMES REFERRED TO YOU AS THE EXPLAINER-IN-CHIEF IN COMPLIMENTING YOUR

ABILITY TO SPEAK BLUNTLY AND TRUTHFULLY. SO HOW SHOULD AMERICANS PLAN ON BEHAVING AS WE MOVE
FORWARD IN THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES?

AND...IF DR FAUCI WAS COMFORTABLE WITH IT, A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS BASEBALL
FANDOM...

WITH ALL THAT’S HAPPENING AROUND US AND YOUR IMPORTANT ROLE IN IT, IT MIGHT SEEM TRITE TO
DISCUSS BASEBALL. BUT I KNOW YOU’VE BEEN A YANKEE FAN FOR MORE THAN 70 YEARS. AND I WOULD LIKE TO
ASK YOU A FEW BASEBALL QUESTIONS.

WHEN AND HOW DID YOUR YANKEE FANDOM BEGIN?

YOU WERE A YOUNGSTER WHEN THE YANKEES WON 5 STRAIGHT WORLD SERIES TITLES FROM 1949-1953,
THE ONLY TIME THAT’S EVER HAPPENED IN BASEBALL HISTORY. WHAT ARE YOUR MEMORIES OF THOSE YEARS?

HOW HAS YOUR BACKGROUND IN SPORTS HELPED YOU IN YOUR ROLE WITH THE NIAID?

AND, FINALLY, YOU’VE SPOKEN ABOUT HOW NEW YORK IS THE EPICENTER OF THE VIRUS. FOR NEW
YORKERS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR SOME LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM?
