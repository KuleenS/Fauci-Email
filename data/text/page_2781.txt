If this is true, which it might not be, there is no clear explanation for why right
now. There will likely be studies coming out that say that the relative proportion
of male:female is closer to 50:50. Even one of the ones that you quoted was
54%

Subject: Interview re: coronavirus patient characteristics

 

Hi Dr Fauci,

I’m sure you’re extraordinarily busy right now, but I’ve seen several studies and reports that coronavirus
seems to disproportionately strike men (making up 54-68% of cases, depending on which study you
reference). | was wondering if you might have any comments to offer on why this might be?

Thank you,

Natalie A Rahhal
