Hard to find data on the status of those still hospitalized in Japan.

James made a very important point yesterday. Although the passengers
are elderly (2,666 passengers), the crew members are relatively young
(1,045 crew members). James also expected the attack rates to be very
high among the crew members (they were housed together in a
relatively small space aboard the ship, perfect conditions for explosive
disease transmission). So this combined data on passengers (elderly)
and crew (young and healthy) will be invaluable in terms of helping
understand severity. I would think that Japan also realizes how
invaluable this data is. Japan will be tn the best position to assess the
impact on the crew, since they will know the results of lab screening
and hospitalization of all + crew members (as well as the monitoring
quarantine of the rest of the crew over the next 14 days). But now that
the passengers are being dispersed, it will be important for several
nations to share the data on these passengers—it is really our best
chance to understand severity (would need collaboration of the US,
Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan).
