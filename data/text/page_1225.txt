dear dr Fauci, good morning. | hope you are fine.

Apologies to disturb you but it may be of your interest. | saw in the web that you (NIAID/Fauci)(

 

will be support a trial using Baricitinib as part of the ACTT trial...

| collaborated with Fabrizio Cantini (he reads in cc), a reumathologist of Prato to write a letter to J Infection
(pdf attached). He conducted an off- label study in patients with mild-moderate pneumonia with COVID-19
[(SpO2) >92% at room-air, and ratio arterial oxygen partial pressure/fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2)
100-300 mmHg] to evaluate the impact of baritinib (tablet 4 mg/day) in terms of safety, clinical respiratory
improvements , discharge, ICU transfer in 2 weeks; these patients received also lopinavir/ritonavir therapy.
The last consecutive patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia receiving standard of care therapy
(lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine) admitted before the date of the first baricitinib-treated patient
served as controls.
