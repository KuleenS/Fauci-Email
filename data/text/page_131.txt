Subject: Following up

Dr Fauci - I cover media and flow of information to public for NPR and am also a host. (You and I once spoke years
ago when I covered Johns Hopkins over a science research issue.)

You told a colleague the report you couldn't comment on Coronavirus was taken out of context. In what way?

Thank you -
D
