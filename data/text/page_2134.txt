too. They need to have high level of hygiene, and ideally no
contact with the customers.

6. Garbage and belongs and bodies need to be burned.

7. Safety protocol at the labs, public and private labs that have
access to the virus or experimental animals with the virus.

8. Plan ahead. Instruct patient to self-treat or be treated by family
at home. If we ever come to it, recruit and train volunteers ( how
and whom?) to help taking care of patients.

Dr. Fauci. Clock is ticking. It's a race against time. And it's time

through the crisis.
