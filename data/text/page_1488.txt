Fauci, together with Wolff, his mentor, wondered if this side effect
could be harnessed to help vasculitis patients, whose immune systems
were overactive. “I thought if we could somehow give a cancer drug at a
low enough dose perhaps we could turn the disease off without any of
the secondary complications,” he recalled recently. “First we did it in a
few patients, and, much to our delight, they had a total remission. Before
you know it, we ended up curing a very, very lethal, albeit uncommon,
disease.”

For the first time, this technique enabled researchers to do effective
work on lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and transplant rejection. “If you
look at immunology, it has from the very beginning been inextricably
linked to infectious diseases,” Fauci said. “What is the immune system
for? The immune system protects you against invaders from without—
microorganisms—as well as, in some cases, the emergence of certain
tumors from within.”

In 1981, a strange new syndrome emerged that transformed Fauci’s
research and, eventually, the lives of millions of people around the
