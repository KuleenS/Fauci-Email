There is much misinformation. I actually have not been muzzled at all by the Vice President. And BTW, it is safe
to fly domestically |

Dear Dr. Fauci,

I understand Vice President Pence has ordered you to not inform the public about Coronavirus without approval.
This is quite terrifying, especially since Trump has already shown his desire to spread false or incomplete
information about this public health crisis.

I’m planning to fly domestically TOMORROW ("0 GF. Is it safe??

Thank you,

Suzanne Bradley
