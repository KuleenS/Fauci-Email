Dr. Fauci: Sending all students home may be Increasing the spread of Covid-19 in
the US because the young people now off college, middle and high school, see this as
a vacation to go out and frequent social businesses, parents are taking kids out to
entertain them, and they are traveling to visit friends in other cities and states, all aiding
the spread of Covid-19.

Please consider more strict MANDATES TO ENFORCE TEMPORARY CLOSING OF
RESTAURANTS, BARS, BOWLING ALLIES, MOVIE THEATERS, MALLS or other
places of gathering and TRAVEL ONLY IF IT IS AN EMERGENCY, to mitigate the
increasing cases of Covid-19 in the US. People are clearly not taking the advice given
to minimize social or public gatherings.

In order for our United States not to follow the same fate as Italy, we need mandated
changes asap. Please consider telling people over 60 or 65 to also stay home from
work for a 2-week period.

Thank you very much for your fine leadership in this critical matter.

Concerned parent and scientist,
Robbin.
