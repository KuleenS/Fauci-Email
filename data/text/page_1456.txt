great. We will just turn around and come back after the ride there--- in our follow
car (we have NIH access badges). Secondly, would it be possible to sit down with
you on camera for 15 minutes once a week (on the weekend?) at the office or on the
back deck/some safe location to talk with me in real time about what you are
managing with treatments, vaccines, etc. so we can pull the
scientific/communication narrative on COVID-19 through your film.

6) We love the live truck and the walks, so whenever that works we will be there.
7) I NEVER ever want to interfere with the work on the Task Force, lives are at
stake. IF something doesn’t work for filming no questions asked we don’t do it, we
stop, cancel/pivot. No need to explain, the team here understands and only wants to
do what works for you, your team...

With appreciation,
