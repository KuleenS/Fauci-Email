Dr. Fauci,

Might you be available to update our viewers on the latest developments in the coronavirus story
today/tonight? We are particularly interested in getting your evaluation of the passengers who have
been released from two cruise ships. The first, in Yokohama, Japan, where over 300 Americans released
from the ship have now arrived back in the US, to go into 14 days of quarantine. 14 of those people
tested positive at some point after leaving the ship, but before they boarded the plane. The second ship
we want to focus on is in Cambodia. Something in the neighborhood of 1,000 passengers released from
that ship have been reported to be in some state of travel to their homes, presumably around the globe.
One woman who made it as far as Malaysia tested positive there and is hospitalized in Kuala Lumpur.
We do know that the CDC is working with WHO and the cruise ship line to track down those traveling
people.

We would very much like to hear from you what level of concern we should have over those many
hundreds of people traveling right now, how well quarantine works, how important it is to maintain it,
etc. We would also like to touch on the methods of containment and treatment being done inside China
and how well those methods have worked.

| realize it is a holiday, and that could complicate things. But please let me know whether you could
consider this, Doctor, and we will begin to work out the logistics.

Thank you.

Very best regards,
Dave
