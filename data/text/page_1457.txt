Dr. Fauci —

Almost embarrassed to ask, but would you be willing/able to speak virtually to the
American Broncho-Esophagological Association (abea.net) on Friday April 24th

 

This year marks the 100" anniversary of this venerable organization that brings
together clinicians (mainly Otolaryngologists) who care for patients with complex
upper aerodigestive tract disorders. Our annual National Meeting has been cancelled
and we are hosting a virtual meeting it it’s stead.

As Otolaryngologists, we are currently and expect to continue to be dramatically
impacted by the current pandemic, given that our care for patients routinely includes
upper airway endoscopy (30-40 scope procedures a day is routine) which as you
know 1s a high-risk aerosolizing procedure. As I’m sure you are aware,
Otolaryngolgists have been amongst the hardest hit clinicians in terms of patient-to-
provider transmission of COVID-19.

Your input for 10-15 minutes would be an honor. Discussion topics could include
general comments about the pandemic, a sense of what to expect in the coming
months and years, and what we can do as medical leaders to prepare for these
changes in the US and abroad.

If this is something you are interested in, with whom on your communications team
could I communicate?

Thanks so much for the consideration — your bricf presence and input would mean a
great deal to our society.
