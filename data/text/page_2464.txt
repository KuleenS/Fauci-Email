Dear Dr. Fauci,

| saw that you are discussing the steps we need to take to make the impact of
COVID-19 a minimum in CNN and decided to write to you what we did as faculty in
this aspect.

| believe that prevention is much more important than treatment later. As a
preparation for the COVID-19 outbreak, two days ago, | made a personal decision
to make all my homework online submission so that we may avoid the spread of
the virus anymore.

Students work on homework for hours and can easily spread the virus without
knowing it. Once it goes to graders (my TAs) , they then spread it to the rest of the
class, again without knowing it. Thus, an innocent act can be devastating. So, in
simply two-three days it may spread to another 100 new individuals easily.
Graders may act as hubs in this case. The danger is, it may have spread to another
hundred or more new individuals even before it comes to a detectable level from
any test.

| also want to emphasis the following points:

1. We hear in all news that elderly people are the most vulnerable. But | think
it should be corrected as people with immunodeficiency are the most
vulnerable and elderly are in that category. Some one who is 10 years old
and have diabetic or HIV has the same danger as an elderly person.

2. We should come up with a test such as a pregnancy test, which can be done
at home without leaving their homes. This stops further spreading.

3. We should discuss focds that help cure it fast and things that we should not
do.
