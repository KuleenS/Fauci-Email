Dear Dr. Anthony S. Fauci,

It's critical to disinfect droplets, aerosols and surfaces continuously to prevent or reduce or
slow down the spread of COVID-19.

The best way is using UVC ultraviolet light. UVC’s wavelength is germicidal and it is capable
to inactivate coronavirus by destroying nucleic acids and

disrupting its DNA because Wavelengths between about 200nm and 300nm are strongly
absorbed by nucleic acids. The absorbed energy can result in

defects including pyrimidine dimers. These dimers can prevent replication or can prevent
the expression of necessary proteins,resulting in the death or

inactivation of the coronavirus.
Fluorescent light lamps emit ultraviolet (UV) light, including UVC ultraviolet light.

| think it's necessary to use fluorescent tube light lamps and CFL (Compact fluorescent
lamps) lamps in hospitals, Health centers, stores, supermarkets,

elevators, public lavatory, toilets, restrooms and other public places and should always be
on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in order to be effective.

Research has shown that Fluorescent light lamps must be installed without any glass shade
or decorative shade and should be at least 40 watts.

| hope you find the UVC-based continuous disinfection solution helpful.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,

P. Salimi
