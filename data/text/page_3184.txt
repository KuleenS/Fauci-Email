Dear Dan,

Thank you! The meeting will be held on February 10th. We are still trying to nail down a
time with Senator Lieberman and Governor Ridge, so | will get back to you about that as
soon as possible, hopefully tomorrow.

The meeting will be open to the public and to the press, but Hudson Institute is a think
tank, so it's never a negative or rowdy crowd.
