The National messages may include the following:

The top priority is the safety and security of the people

We will make decisions based on health guidance and current conditions here and
elsewhere

We will get through this together (share resources, express kindness etc.)

We need to care for each other - It is vital it is to unite around this crisis

As a Nation, we need to come together as a community to survive this international
disaster

This health crisis is challenging each of us to make sacrifices and implement
changes out of the norm.

Ultimately, this crisis is not about us. It’s about our responsibility to each other.
Thank you for all you are doing during this difficult time.

Thank you, Sir, for taking the time to review this correspondence.

Best regards,
