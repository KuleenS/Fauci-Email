Dear Dr. Fauci,

Thank you for your leadership and guidance in this
difficult time. | am a pediatrician in Massachusetts,
and as you know, direct-linkage from travel cases are
popping up on the East Coast. In order to keep the
community viral load down, keeping new cases from
moving around the country and the world will delay
the spread and amplification of the viral

load. According to my observations, hot climates
seem to be having a favorable new case rate. Based
on the city of Qom versus the experience in
Singapore and Australia, it appears that the transition
temperature for efficient spread is somewhere above
when there are highs around 50 degrees F, similar to
H1N1. According to my observations, prior to
seasonal flu, the transition temperature was closer to
highs of 40 degrees F. This theory should be
testable. For example, there are new cases in Kuwait
and Bahrain. If | am right, if you tested a subset of
these populations, you would find a very high rate of
asymptomatic infection, probably 80-90%, because
that's how many people it would take to shed small
amounts of virus to create a community viral load to
make someone sick enough to get tested. If this is
true, this bodes well for the virus burning itself out to
endemic status relatively quickly. This would be very
reassuring data you could provide to reduce panic - if
you can tell people you know how long this pandemic
is going to last rather than saying that we don't know.

Although some experts may say that restricting travel
will only delay the inevitable, this is not a valid
statement if the transition temperature for effect
spread really is 50 degrees. A delay of significant
community spread in the US until highs reach the 50s
for the Northeast where the population is the most
