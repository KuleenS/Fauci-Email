Evening Dr. Fauci,

My name is David Craig and |am one of the Founders of the Medsoft Group, a
Analytics, Telemetry and Reporting medical platform out of Canada. We would like
to offer our solution to the NIH free of charge, much like we have done with Dr.
Bruce Aylward and the World Health Organization earlier today.

Our application will track, log and provide a pathway to true two-way real time
communication of COVID-19 as citizens around the US report their symptoms on
their mobile device. We are currently implementing our technology with our
partners at the University of Alberta, but we would like to refocus our immediate
attention in helping with the novel coronavirus.

Deployment of our application would allow the NIH to manage and understand
potential clusters and outbreaks of the pandemic, taking advantage of the
estimated 96% of Americans that use a smart phone to easily record a potential
case, providing all stakeholders across the US with the latest information.
Medsoft Group is ready to offer this immediately and without delay. With your
cooperation we believe we could be up and running within a week, providing this
invaluable tool to better understanding where and what the virus is doing around
the country in real time.

Please let me know if you would like to speak further. We would be happy to
demonstrate our technology as well as discuss how we would put this ambitious
plan into place.

Best,
David Craig

Co-founder &Chief Executive Officer
Medsoft Group Inc.
