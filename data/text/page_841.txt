Fox 5 Good Day New York
To date we've raised over $6,150 for New York City's Public Health System (NYC Health +
Hospitals). We've created limited ecition t-shirts (including a Fauci's Revenge one). We've
donated 6,150 Protective Suits and 4,500 Gloves to the NYC Mayor’s Office and face shields to
Maimonides Medical Center. Men for others!

 

Looking forward to being back in the halls soon at a Jug Night or Career Day. Enjoy the game!

Best,
