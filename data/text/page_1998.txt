Subject: Re: Coronavirus interview with Dr. Collins

  

Hi there,

Why were we told we could not do an interview, when, after our request, he did one with The
Atlantic. You referred us to Dr. Fauci but he isn't talking, either. This doesn't seem fair to us. Can we
really not speak to either of them for a story this weekend?

Thanks, SK
