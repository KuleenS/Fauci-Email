Dear Tony,

we are all witnessing the great effort your collaborators and yourself are investing over this pandemic
emergency.

As you well know, in Europe and Italy we had the unfortunate privilege of having been first hit hard by
the pandemic, after China.

We had the opportunity of meta-analyzing data from 170.000 patients in European countries, for
associated determinants of the spreading force of COVID-19.

lf this may provide a useful, albeit non gratifying, contribution for the US and other countries, we would
feel we had done our job.

best wishes

Saverio
