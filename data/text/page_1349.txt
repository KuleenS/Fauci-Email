Subject: Dr. Fauci - FROM NBC4

Hello Dr. Fauci,

This is Melissa Mollet, reporter with NBC4 in Washington. I hope you are well -
and safe - and are hanging in there during this unprecedented time. You have been
doing an incredible job.

I know you’re getting a million emails, so my apologies in advance. I really think
this information (attached and below) could help and I feel a responsibility to pass it
along.

There is an extremely promising COVID- 19 therapy being used right now in Italy.
The creator is a client off{___- ©] Bethesda law firm. The managing member
of that firm, Jeremy Schulman, is CC’d on this e-mail. The creator is willing to work
with the NIH to quickly bring his therapy to the U.S.

Please reach out with any questions at all.

Best -

Melissa Mollet
