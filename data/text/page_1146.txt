Patty | had spoken to ASF about using a few slides and he said yes / | will have them done
short:y

- V Dzau: | will begin the session by providing brief (~3
min) opening remarks describing the circumstances
of the pandemic. Then, | will introduce the panelists
and you will each have 7 minutes to provide
remarks. You may use a limited number of slides for
illustration. | hope that each panelist will provide
their own perspective and speak to the issues
proposed below.

- Jeremy Farrar will discuss the global response to the
pandemic, drawing from his experience as a global
leader, the chair of the Scientific Advisory Group for
the WHO's R&D Blueprint and as a member of the
Global Preparedness Monitoring Board.
