Dear Dr. Fauci,

Thank you for your useful editorial published in NEJM last week, it helps confirming that the situation
does not need to be as glim as the panic that most people are experiencing.

|am writing an editorial and hoping to submit it to The Lancet soon. Differently from NIH/US
Government institutes, | have more room for reflection in my viewpoint.

For that reason, | was wondering if | can have a call with you to get your opinion/advice on the direction
of my editorial. | know how busy you are and | can understand if you do not have the time, but if by
chance you are willing to have this call, I'll be happy to share my editorial’s draft first.

As a background, | am an EIS graduate (class of 2009), and trained by Robert T. Chen.

Thanks,

Charbel El Bcheraoui, PhD, MSc
