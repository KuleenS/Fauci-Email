As many lives are at stake, I thought I will sensitize you on this. Hope something
good will come out of this. I am telling whomever I come across about the same.
That is the best | can do. Hope the current scenario will show the living daylight for
reserpine and helps the humanity.

Thank you

With regards
Jamuna
