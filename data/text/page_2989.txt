Subject: RE: Redfield/Fauci nCoV op-ed

Attached is a tracked changes version and a clean version of what cleared the WH — they had a few
sentences they would like to be added (which, in the tracekd changes version, | have added comments
to explain who suggested it and in some cases why), but almost all of these edits are non-substantive.

Assuming CDC and NIAID are good with these (feel free to modify the additions as needed), you all are

good to pitch this as you wish -—F— CF}
