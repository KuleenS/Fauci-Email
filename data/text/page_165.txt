Much appreciation for all of your work pasi and present. | am a cardiologist in New Jersey and when I read that the
virus attaches to the AT2 receptors in the lungs [ couldn’t help but think that maybe the class of ARB’s that we use
so frequently for HTN and heart failure management could possibly block entry of virus into cells and prevent or
mitigate the severity of infection. Has this epproach ever been studied and is it worth looking into? Imagine if ARBs
could lessen the severity of infection how readily available and relatively inexpensive this class of medication is!
Would appreciate if someone could get back to inform me whether you received this message. Thanks. Dr Thomas
