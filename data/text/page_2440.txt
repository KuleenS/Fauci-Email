dense would have a massive life-saving effect, but if
this is to occur, the flight restriction needs to happen
now.

Stopping all flights would be impractical and
inhumane, but allowing return flights only and
stopping all other air travel would be effective. It
would have a massive effect on the economy, but so
will overwhelming corona virus infection. No one will
die because they can't take a vacation or business
trip. Financial losses would need to be settled later,
so this would require emergency declarations, etc. If
you wanted to take it in a step-wise manner, you
could start with international flights and then move on
to domestic flights if necessary - this would probably
be wise and would have a less severe impact on the
economy.

Thank you again, and | am sure this Is one of
thousands of unsolicited emails. | wish you the very
best and God grant you wisdom.
