Dear Dr. Fauci -- many thanks for your time today; we are thrilled to have you as part of the
TIME 100 Talks, which will go live tomorrow.

In the meantime, | wanted to double check the reference to the study you mentioned about the
east and west coast strains and their potential difference in virulence. Realize it's preliminary,
so just wanted to confirm any references we make to it. | checked the biorxiv and medrxiv but
didn't find the citation. Would appreciate the journal if it was published. Many thanks! Alice
