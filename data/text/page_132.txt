Thanks for the note. Iam sure that the Chinese are looking at this, but ] have not seen any data in this regard, I
will try to find out if anyone is looking at this in the USA patients.
Best regards,
Tony

Does anyone know what the NK cell profile was like in patients who succumbed to Coronavirus? Is there a
difference in immune profile between mild and severe cases?

Anyone looking at that?
