Hi Tony,

It may not be as pertinent as it was when we submitted it, but | thought you might be interested in our
modeling on the global spread of COVID-19. It is in press at PNAS.

We also have a paper submitted to them about ICU and ventilator inadequacy in the US. I'd be happy to
send it to you now or wait until after the peer-review process.

Thank you for everything you do to lead us through these crises.

All the best,
Alison
