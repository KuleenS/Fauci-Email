Brett:

The proposal below was sent to my office by David Margulies (Harvard/Boston Childrens) who is part of
a group of prominent physicians and healthcare executives in Boston developing this idea (David Martin
of the Brigham, Gary Gottlieb of Partners and others). See this op-ed they wrote in the Boston Globe

yesterday regarding their proposal https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/25/opinion/mass-needs-
comprehensive-care-response-coronavirus/).

 

Can you take a look at this and let me know what you think, OG J. David

Margulies can be contacted directly at{ ©) @ orf) GF if you need

additional information.

Thanks,
Tony
