Dr. Fauci,

 

& gong
over 30 years), and am exploring Coronavirus from the perspective of a combination of the venom of the
Vietnamese Six Eyed Sand Spider (entering the cells externally), Habanero capsaicin entering cells internally, the
elevated water levels of infants and children and their higher levels of Qi in relation to them not getting the disease,
and Qi from Traditional Chinese Medicine, Acupuncture, and Qigong.

I believe that the above combination can be beneficial in the study of Coronavirus. I am sure you are extremely
busy andI am but a simple author but I just wanted to try to touch bases in case the above might help.

Live in <5)
I would be truly honored to hear from you.
