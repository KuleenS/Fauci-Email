| am not that excited about doing this. They have CDC doing the Epi, which is fun. They have
Ralph Baric doing the virology, which | easily can do, and they have me talking about what
NIAID is doing, which is important, but boring from a lecture standpoint.
Greg:

What say you?

(resending with Patty’s correct email address)
Dear Dr Fauci:

As | mentioned on the phone, we just today decided that we will have a special session on
COVID-19 at CROI. It will be on Tuesday, March 10, during the lunch break; the initial
general structure will be a 10- to 15- minute overview of the epidemic (CDC), a 25-min talk
by Ralph Barac (UNC) about the virology of coronaviruses, and a 10- to 15-minute
summary on what NIAID/NIH is doing and planning. We thought that this being one of the
first large medical conferences in infectious diseases this year, that it is important that we
address COVID 19 at CROI.
