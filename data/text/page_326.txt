Dear Dr Fauci,

Many thanks for your quick reply and for the clear list of responses regarding the proof. | will review
today and will let you know if there are any items needing further discussion.

The current plan is for publication early Friday afternoon. As | mentioned yesterday, there is anew
article on Covid-19 that is also scheduled for publication that day, and the Journal editors would like you
to mention it in your editorial. | expect to be able to send you a proof of that article sometime today.

Best,
Eli
