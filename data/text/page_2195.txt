Dear Dr. Fauci

I don't want to overburden you with a long email, so I'll try and
get to the point.

First, we have developed a gene expression system, our C1 cell
line which is significantly more efficient than traditional cell
lines being used by Big Pharma to manufacture recombinant
vaccines and drugs. The hyper productive Cl cells can be
grown at flexible commercial scales and are proving to be the
most efficient, cost effective way to produce the tens of
millions of preventative vaccines and/or antibody treatments
the world so desperately needs.

In a collaboration with Sanofi, C1 cells were developed to
produce recombinant proteins for use in manufacturing a lower
cost better performing influenza vaccine. After conducting a
