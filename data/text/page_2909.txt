"We have seen a flurry of activities from other companies," CEO Paul Hudson told a news
conference after Sanofi published 2019 results on Thursday.

"We are one of the few companies that has the expertise to know when it is just a fantasy, or
when it could be real. In the next week or two, you will see something more confirmatory about
the approach we will take."

Hudson declined to give further details.

Sanofi had already said it was sharing its expertise and data acquired from other outbreaks with
the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is working with biotech
businesses to try to develop a vaccine candidate for the coronavirus.

Britain's GlaxoSmithKline 1s also collaborating with CEPI.

"The objective here is not a newspaper headline, it is real work that will make a difference,"
Hudson said.
