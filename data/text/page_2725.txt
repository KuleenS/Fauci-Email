Subject: for review: proposed responses for Italian media request

 

Dr. Fauci —

This is not urgent for today. A reporter from the Italian health website Pazienti.it reached out to you
directly with questions about coronavirus vaccine development. | have drafted proposed responses for
your review attached and pasted below. | will send the final responses to the reporter attributed to you.
Coronavirus vaccine: when will it be available? What are the difficulties?

The National Institutes of Health is on track to test an experimental messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine ina
Phase 1 clinical trial this spring. This first phase of clinical testing will involve giving the vaccine to
healthy adults in the United States to See if it is safe and if it can induce an immune response in
recipients. It is important to realize that the development of investigational vaccines and the clinical
testing to establish their safety and effectiveness takes time. A vaccine against the novel coronavirus will
likely not be widely available for at least a year.
