Subject: FW: Requested coronavirus talking points for press conference

 

HHS has asked us for your talking points for the press conference by 11am. We were planning to
resubmit these. As was the case last time, this is a placeholder for the WH to know the outlines of what
you would say. This is not a script.

Is it OK for us to send this to Bill?
