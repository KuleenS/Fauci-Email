Hi, Dr. Fauci. Hope you're well

Spoke with some passengers aboard the Diamond
Princess cruise ship in Japan, where the number of
coronavirus cases onboard are jumping. Can we do
a brief interview re: thoughts on quarantining on
board ship (with, I would assume a closed
circulating air system) versus evacuating them?

I'm available at your earliest convenience. Or, if
you'd like to just email some thoughts, that'd be
great. Thanks and best.
