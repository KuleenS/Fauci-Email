Dr. Fauci,

Iam a Nurse Practitioner for the US Army. I have a recommendation as we move
through this terrible time in the US as well as the world. To preserve the healthcare workforce why not
give 25% of all health workers in the military the trial vaccine? Keep these workers away from patients
until which time that the body can build immunity. Let's not expose the entire medical workforce to the
COVID-19. The idea is that this 25% can take care of the population (post-vaccine) without worry of
getting ill and causing further spread of the disease. If there is possibility of the vaccine, trial age cohorts
and demographics could play a crucial part in testing. Thank you for all you are doing to protect the
health of our Nation.

Respectfully,
