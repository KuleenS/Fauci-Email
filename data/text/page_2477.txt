those infected with SARS-CoV-2 may remain symptom free or develop mild disease, or recover from more
severe illness. Currently there are tens cf thousands of individuals who have been identified as having been
infected but are considered ‘recovered’. That being case it would seem plausible that they have mounted an
antibody response to the virus.

The question is whether these individuals are being tested for antibody titre to the virus, and if that is
occurring whether they are being approached to donate plasma to move into lgiv production. With this
illness still in its early stages and being international, | would imagine that such an effort would involve a
public/private sector endeavor. Understanding the difficulty in developing a vaccine for ‘cold viruses’, lvIG
may be a way to at least reduce the mortality in our most vulnerable patients. So, the slow start we have had
in testing the US population for this virus goes beyond disease prevention - it would certainly be affecting our
ability, to some degree, of rapidly developing a more targeted intervention for high risk patients.

Again, you may have already thought of this, but as a concerned citizen having some background and an
C8) 6},1 wanted to share these thoughts. Understanding your busy schedules, | have
copied both the Director and Deputy Director for Clinical Research and Special Projects.
