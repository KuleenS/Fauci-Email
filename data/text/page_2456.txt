Unfortunately, when | tried to make a greater prep for a phase | trial, the viral preparation
turned out (too late),
by SDS gel elecrophoresis, not to contain any viral protein, due either to degradation or
another mishap. | left Zagury’s lab soon after and it was impossible for me later to obtain
material (either viral or from recombinant protein) to further advance the matter. | do
believe that tuning vaccine preparation to counter immunosuppressive effect of the virus
(parasite) while preserving its capacity to induce anti viral immunity should resolve the
need to revaccinate every year against the same virus. In fact, identifying the epitopes,
acting for immunity and those
acting against immunosuppression, at a later stage should allow a better result than we
obtained. (It is not yet Known whether corona virus also mutates rapidly, but | heard that
a woman was reinfected after having recovered from covid-19 infection and this might
indicate a capacity of the virus to counteract the host’s immune response.

In | have been itching ever since to go back to
unfinished projects, but did not
find an avenue. Now, with the outburst of the corona virus pandemic this surfaces again.

| Sincerely
