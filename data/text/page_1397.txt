Since many of us have moved to remote work environments, you may already be proficient with Zoom
and other online meeting/collaboration applications. | am attaching a ‘speaker guidelines’ file in case
you have any questions on how best tc prepare for and stage your remote talk. We have technical staff
available to help you become familiar with Zoom and its settings — such as “sharing your screen” (if you
have slide presentations that need to be shown during your talk). We can arrange for a training session
this week or next week. If you would like to schedule a session, please let me know as soon as possible.

Dr. Dzau’s office will be in touch regarding the agenda for this session. If you have any other questions,
please let me know.

Regards, Jenny
