MERS and SARS

Dear Dr. Fauci,
Is it possible that DDP4 and ACE2 inhibitors would be effective in preventing
coronavirus entry and thereby 'de-rail' the infectious cycle?

Thank you for your work and guidance to NIAID!

Sincerely,

Joel R.L. Meyer

“Coronavirus entry is initiated by the binding of the spike
protein (S) to cell receptors, specifically, dipeptidyl peptidase 4
(DDP4) and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for MERS-
CoV and SARS-CoV, respectively [1—5]”
