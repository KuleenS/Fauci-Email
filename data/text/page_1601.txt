Hi, Dr. Fauci.

Thank you so much for keeping things honest and know that | am such a champion of you.

| hope that reaching out is okay. | work at HHS/IOS team. As | sit here at home and have been
thinking about the shortage of medical supplies, doggie cones actually can be used as
protection for our health care workers. Just a thought that looks and sounds crazy but can

help.

Stay safe.
