Dr. Fauci,

I have Paul Offit coming on my podcast tomorrow to discuss coronavirus, and I
would love to have you on after him to talk about your thoughts and what we should
do. My friend Nikki Roy recommended you who I have also interviewed for my
vaccine show "Straight To The Point." If you're intercsted we can do an intervicw at
your earliest convenience. My listeners would benefit greatly from it, thank you for
your consideration.
