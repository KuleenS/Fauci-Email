Tony, | have been writing an annual April 1 column for 30 years, first in my monthly newsletter at Cape
Cod Hospital and now as my biweekly blog of medical fun facts at www.hubslist.org. This is a heads up
before publication of this year’s April 1blog about you and Biden.

| suspect that most of our classmates are, like me, boasting a bit about having you as a classmate. Your
honesty and “truthiness” is most appreciated and greatly valued by us amidst the leadership chaos. Your
success at “walking the line” is extraordinary.

Enjoy. Hub
