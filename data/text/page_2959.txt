Any progress on this Michelle? Here is language that I’m thinking of.

For an additional amount for “National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases”, to prevent, prepare for, and respond to SARS-CoV-2, a virus strain

mutating therefrom (“coronavirus”), or other emerging or reemerging infectious
disease threats, domestically or internationally, $xxx,000,000, to remain available
