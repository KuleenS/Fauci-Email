Subject: BIO Coronavirus Collaboration Initiative March 12th Summit -
POSTPONED

Dear Colleagues,

BIO is heartened that so many of you have expressed interest in
joining us for the BIO Coronavirus Collaboration Initiative Summit
planned for March 12, 2020. Given the evolving circumstances
surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, and after discussions with
our Board leadership, we have decided to postpone the BIO
Summit so that we can make adequate arrangements to hold the
meeting virtually. We made this decision out of an abundance of
caution, so as to avoid placing anyone at unnecessary risk of
exposure while we work together to improve our nation’s ability to
respond to this outbreak. We will re-schedule this virtual meeting
within the next two weeks using a digital technology that can allow
for robust discussion among the participants.

In the interim, we plan to send out a short questionnaire on
Monday to all company participants requesting information on your
product, technology or service, which we plan to compile in a
digital “book” and share with all participants in advance of the
meeting. We believe this approach will help to make the meeting
more efficient, allowing us to quickly shift to discussions of the

NIH-000820
