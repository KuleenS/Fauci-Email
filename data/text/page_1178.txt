Dear Dr. Fauci,
dear Dr. Coomes,

thank you for your reply from 13. April with the notice that the information has been shared with NIAID’s
COVID-19 research team.

Has the project already been initially evaluated by the team?
Are there any questions or need for additional information?

e | have summed up the relevant data regarding the use of proteasome inhibitors for treatment of
COVID-19 patients with acute lung and systemic organ failure in a position paper, please find a
Preview draft attached.

e With regard to currently ongoing trials with monoclonal antibodies against the IL-6 receptor, i.e.
tocilizumab or sarilumab: These approaches go into the same direction as the present
suggestion, however, inhibition of NF-KB by proteasome inhibitors could provide the unique
potential to inhibit the release of multiple cytokines simultaneously, in particular strongly pro-
inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-6, TNFa and chemokines, such as MIP-1 and CXCL1.

e This simultaneous inhibition of multiple cytokines/chemokine seems to be advantegeaus
compared to single target approaches (as with the mAb) to compensate for redundant and
synergistic effects of multiple cytokines released during highly pathogenic CoV or H5N1
infection.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,

Ralf
