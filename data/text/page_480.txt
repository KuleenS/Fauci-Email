-Sneeze or cough produces respiratory droplet or aerosolized respiratory secretion which make contract
with upper or lower respiratory mucosa, which results in infection of human cells. Seems most likely.

- What about contact transmission, contaminated hand to conjunctivae, nasal mucosa, or mouth

- Fecal/oral

- transmission to fetus

-What are the diagnostic tests to confirm diagnosis of novel coronavirus? PCR of secretions? Who in the
world has these test kit; who manufactures kit.

-Are follow up serologies begin done?

Interesting questions to us and to Shelly Wolf if he were with us.
Thanks, Tony. My voice is also a little raspy.

Best,
Dick

Hi, Tony
| continue to follow the Cobid-19 epidemic.
What is the problem with your voice. It crackles like mine. | attribute mine to 'postnasal drip.'

WHO and Dr. Tedros are looking much better on TV. He has the WHO logo in the background. His tie
show be tighter. His slouch is better. He still puts his elbows on the table in front of him.

Looking forward to lunch with you.

Best,
Dick
