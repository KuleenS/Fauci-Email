Subject: Washington Post story re: Sammies finalists

Hello Tony,

Congratulations on being a Career Achievement finalist for the Samuel J. Heyman
Service to America Medals (Sammies). I'm writing a Federal Insider column about the
finalists and would like arrange a telephone interview with your for the story.

My questions include:

Why did you join the federal service?

Is there one example or anecdote that makes you particularly proud of you work?

What do you like most about your job?

What do you like least about your job?

Why would you recommend, or not, your agency and/or the federal government to those
seeking career advice?

I know this is an incredibly busy time for you. I appreciate that the life and death issues
related to the coronavirus are more important than any award. Nonetheless, I hope you
