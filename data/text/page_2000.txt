Hi Tony,

| could use your guidance on press interviews. | understand that only Task Force members are
supposed to do television events — and | declined the NewsHour tonight to be consistent with
that. But what is your preference for printed press pieces, when you can’t do them all? Would
it help the cause for me to accept some of those, or is it better to hold off? If | were to engage,
| would certainly seek to provide answers that are 100% with what you are doing.

An example is the thread from Sheila Kaplan of the New York Times. | have declined so far —
but is this the kind of query that you would like some help with?

Francis
