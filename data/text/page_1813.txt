Dear Dr. Fauci,

| hope all goes well. | wanted to quickly follow up and see if you might be
free for a quick interview on Monday — it would mean so much to include
your voice in the piece.

Is there a time on Monday that might work for you? We can jump on the
phone for a 5 - 10 minute call if that works better for you.

Best,
Ben

run the digital magazine, Frame, which publishes interactive
documentaries made for mobile phones. We are working on a story about
the current effort to create a coronavirus vaccine and would love to
interview you for the piece.

 

We've interviewed Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer, George
Yancopoulos, and the piece will tell the story of Regeneron's push to
create a coronavirus vaccine in record time. | was hoping you could speak
to the broader issue of the often undercovered global threat of diseases
and the lack of funding going toward infectious diseases.
