Subject: Here and working
Hi Patty:

Zac and | are here and situated. | know you are drinking through ten firehoses. | want
to preserve sleep and health for Dr. Fauci. But it would be fantastic to have a 15
minute video (with distancing) Q and Ain the garden of his house or in the house
this week--- what he is working on just scientifically—vaccines, treatments, disease
understanding. | want to capture the focus and urgency of the real time scientific
work on COVID-19. If we need to we can figure out how to do it with audio, but
would love to see if we could do this in 15 minutes on video. Again, anytime this

week.
