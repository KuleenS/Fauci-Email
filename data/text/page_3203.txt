“We are taking on an individual-by-individual basis what’s the regulatory need for anything in China ...
versus what are the personnel risks associated,” he said.

Monitoring the the situation in China could soon get trickier as the State Department expands
mandatory evacuation from affected areas of the country.

The coronavirus also broke out in an election year when President Donald Trump wants to deliver on his
promise to bring down drug prices — not traditionally the province of the FDA, a regulatory agency
designed to focus on safety and efficacy.

“If my patients couldn’t get access to something because of cost — that was a real problem for me as a
doctor. Now I’m on the other end of that, but what can we do to make sure that that pipeline flows in
the best way possible?” said Hahn, 60, an oncologist, researcher and Washington newcomer.

Hahn was confirmed as commissioner on Dec. 18, the night before the administration announced its
plan to let states import cheaper medicines from Canada — an approach that prior FDA commissioners
opposed over fears it would jeopardize the safety of the drug supply. Trump has endorsed letting states
such as Florida do this.
