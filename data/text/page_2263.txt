Dear Zunyou, John, Ralph and Tony,

Thank you for your superb presentations in the Special COVID-19 Session at the Virtual
CRO! 2020. As you can imagine, your presentations were very much appreciated by all the
audience. There is great thirst for more information at this point in time, which made your
presentations particularly timely and impactful.

All the best,
Wafaa
