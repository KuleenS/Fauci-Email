2. Migrating current ED/ICU
(non-COVID) patients to other
care sites is great idea.

3. Caring for COVID-19
patients:leveraging ED/ICU
personnel for high compliance and
usage of limited resources (PPE
everything that goes with it) 1s
very critical. Strategic usage and
minimizing non-medical staff 1s
necessary --- either these operators
are well-trained and protected, or
they cannot be there.

4. Concentrating care within
ED/ICU for COVID-19 ensures
rapid learning and sharing of
knowledge among workers as they
take care of these patients.
Clearly from the standpoint of
data collection and clinical
symptoms recording and
organization, it is more feasible
and allow for immediate analysis
and feedback.

5. Strategic prioritization of
limited resources is extremely
important. We must do it now,
because the supply chain is
already being affected and it can
go worse.

6. Primary care and call centers
are good. If you want to do
strategic testing, this is also a good
place to involve.
