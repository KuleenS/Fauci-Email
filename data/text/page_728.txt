Hi Mikael,

Wow, sounds like you are making fantastic progress with the vaccine program, and
we would certainly not want to do anything to slow you down! | understand that
you are evaluating several MRNA formats with BioNTech. If one of those turned
out to be ready for phase II/IIl in late June, we would be most interested in the
possibility of including that inthe master protocol. Please keep Tony and mein
touch with Pfizer's progress, including which mRNA format you choose to move
into advanced development.

Hope to hear your voice at the ACTIV Leadership Group meeting on Wednesday.
There will be a lot to talk about!

Best, Francis
