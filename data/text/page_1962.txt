Subject: Possible joint collaboration Polish -American Collaboration

Dear Dr Anthony Fauci ,

| am writing in connection to email from Prof Robert Schwartz about possible Polish
- American collaboration in the clinical trial focus on treatment patients suffer from
COVID-19

As a Polish Medical Research Agency we desire facing this pandemic
with NIAID leading vaccine and therapy efforts against SARS-Cov-2.

F. Gray Handley has got in contact with the President of our Agency last week but
from that time we have no further information in this pressing issue.

| will be very appreciated if we could discussed with you or your eminent staff any
possibility for polish scientists to joint collaboration with NIAID to fight coronavirus
for patients all of the world.

| will be personally responsible to hold this topic on behalf of Polish Medical
Research Agency.
