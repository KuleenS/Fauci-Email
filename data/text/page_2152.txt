Dr. Fauci:

If your predictions come true, the entire medical system will soon be
overwhelmed. Only massive use of telemedicine will be able to cope with the
overload.

I'ma former TV reporter, now full-time writer, with nine books in print. One of
them - “Webcam Sawvy for Telemedicine" -- can help those in the medical
community quickly learn how to use this medium. It is available at amazon.com
in both print & digital versions. https://smile.amazon.com/Webcam-Savwy-

T'll attach a PDF copy to this message & also send the same message without an
attachment, just in case your system rejects messages with attachments. I can
also overnight you a print copy if you'd like. Bulk pricing is available for both
print & digital versions.

You've become a rock star in the current crisis. As a long-time on-camera
coach, I don't think I could teach you a THING you haven't already mastered.
Congratulations.

Cheers,
