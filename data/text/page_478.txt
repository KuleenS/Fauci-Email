This definitely feels like an inflection point in the coronavirus outbreak - both in the unsurprising way it’s spreading
and the equally unsurprising misinformation and public alarm/panic we are seeing. Unsurprising but here we are.
Can you give me a quick brain dump on where you think we are and how I can best inform the public?

Thanks,
Jon

P.S. please let me know whenever I can report that the outbreak is officially being called a pandemic.
