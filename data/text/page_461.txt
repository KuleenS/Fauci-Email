Hi all,
Attached is a draft of the Secretary's remarks for this evening’s potential press briefing. Some of this is

rote/repeated from yesterday or this morning’s testimony; | have put the new content in yellow to
accelerate review.

Please let me know if you have edits to this by 2:45 PM.
Thank you!

Best,
Patrick
