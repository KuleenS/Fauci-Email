There may be nothing to this, but we should at least be aware.

Subject: Hazardous use of Remdesivir in CoV-19
Dear Dr Fauci,

lam copying below a letter | just sent to the editors of Lancet and NEJM that | think you should
also read. It's informal as it is not meant for publication but just as a concern. Since | no longer
work as a virologist, | am formally out of the field. |am however active as chief psychiatrist in
Stockholm, Sweden. If you have doubts as to my expertise as a virologist or a physician, Dr
Bernard Roizman at U of C knows me very well, as Markus Heilig does here in Sweden.

"I have noticed a striking difference in mortality by CoV-19 in different countries.
China and Italy have a mortality that's at least 6-fold higher than that in South Korea.
So far Germany and Scandinavia, totalling over 1300 cases, have not reported a single
death. That's over a 35-40 fold difference.

Looking at the data more closely, | have found that China and Italy have been using
the antiviral Remdesivir (Gilead Sciences) extensively on many patients in intensive
care, justified as "compassionate use". In the epidemic arcas of Italy this drug is now
part of treatment guidelines for hospitalised patients, used on every single patient in
"critical condition". (see attachment). The "rationale" 1s stmply that the first two cases
treated at the Spallanzani Hospital in Rome received this drug, and...well, actually
survived.
