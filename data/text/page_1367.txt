Subject: UPDATE: COVID-19 Response Corps - FEMA challenges

 

Here’s areport about a challenge | didn’t see until this morning. | don’t know if grants to state and local
authorities would be quicker than federal hiring by FEMA. Either way, the workforce is needed, but will
take longer than one would like.

FEMA, Racing to Provide Virus Relief, is Running Short on Front-Line Staff

WASHINGTON — The Federal Emergency Management Agency, the office leading the federal
government’s coronavirus response nationwide, is running short of employees who are trained in some
of its most important front-line jobs, according to interviews with current and former officials.

At the same time, the agency has been forced to halt a major hiring initiative, and has closed training
facilities to avoid spreading the infection.

The number of available personnel who are qualified to lead field operations has fallen to 19 from 44 in
less than six weeks, and staff members have been pulled from responding to other disasters, but training
centers in Maryland and Alabama have been shuttered until mid-May. In addition, an effort to recruit
new employees called “Harness” is on hold, according to a senior administration official with direct
knowledge of FEMA’s operations....

Craig Fugate, who ran the agency during the Obama administration, said FEMA’s ability to deploy
enough people was a significant challenge. “Can it be done? Yeah,” Mr. Fugate said. “Will it be pretty?
No.”
