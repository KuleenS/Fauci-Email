Hi Dr. Fauci,

Pardon the intrusion into your email. | am sure you are super busy spearheading the fight
against COVID-19, hence | will cut to the chase. If your research team is looking for ideas to
manage this novel virus, perhaps you can consider adjuvant minocycline. Personally |
conducted a small proof of concept study with minocycline in veterans with PTSD and am now
collaborating with the San Francisco VA for a larger and definitive study. The point | am making
that minocycline has potential benefits beyond antibacterial.. | see that there is preliminary
evidence that it can slow down viral replication.

Anyway you are the international expert and we all THANK YOU for all that you do!

Best,
