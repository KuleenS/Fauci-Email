Hi again Paul,

One more question — is the pharma collaboration mentioned in the BioCentury
story below the same thing as the Gates COVID Therapeutic Accelerator Program?
Or is this something different? I’m just trying to understand the landscape.

Best, Francis

Pharmas on one page with action plan to solve COVID-19 together

BIOCENTURY IS PROVIDING THIS STORY FOR FREE GIVEN THE URGENT NEED FOR
INFORMATION ABOUT THE COVID-19 CRISIS.

A grand-scale behind-the-scenes effort by the pharmaceutical companies is under
way to expedite the creation of therapies and vaccines to treat COVID-19.

According to the participants who spoke with BioCentury under conditions of
anonymity, R&D heads from at least 10 companies have been gathering several
times a week, setting in motion an action plan to use their top talent in different
disciplines to produce an industry-wide response, the likes of which haven’t been
seen since the private sector’s coordinated contribution during World War Il.

Regulatory heads and manufacturing heads have been holding meetings as well,
coordinating to minimize duplication of effort, streamline work and advance
efficient testing of compounds and vaccines.

The R&D group is creating working principles to accelerate new COVID-19 therapies
and vaccines agnostic to their market potential, eliminating bureaucratic and
technical or scientific barriers, and focusing on filling gaps not adequately filled by
other initiatives and which the consortium is uniquely suited to address.
