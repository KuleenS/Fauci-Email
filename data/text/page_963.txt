preventing other infections from entirely different RNA viruses (such as
protecting against influenza). Therefore, it should be really helpful for
some months, and | think get us past a second wave of SARS-CoV-2,
and help people return to work safely. | don’t understand delays or
apparent lack of interest. Who can possibly be against this? If you hear
of hypothetical problems we can show you that these are false. Just
ask the questions, and we can give you the evidence.

However, no answer from you suggests no interest and must quickly
make alternative pathways. | am though quite surprised and fear you
are receiving “fake news” if you will pardon the expression. Some have
been against this who defend their old and failed position on polio
eradication with their promotion of the use of the inactivated polio
virus vaccine. Please note that in the US between 1962 and 1985 we
received (safely) the oral polio (OPV). Moreover, if vaccinated already
there has not been a single case of a complication and BILLIONS have
received it. No it will not last long as innate immunity is short lived, but
we strongly believe that we can break the back of the SARS-CoVID-2
spread. Also note that this is what Bill Gates is doing now in India and
much of the Eastern hemisphere.

There are countries outside the US wanting to move fast on this. We
are waiting for your reply.
