Subject: Request for interview

Dr. Fauci,

My name is Larry “The Amigo" Milian and I am the National General Manager and
Program Director for SLAM Radio on Sirius XM 145. I would like to respectfully
request to have you on with me on my national morning show to update and discuss
Coronavirus.

I will be on air tomorrow starting at 7am est. While my show normally ends at
llam, I have decided to stay on air in order to keep our listeners properly informed.

I would like to thank you in advance. Kindly email me or call me back
(J) and let me know what might be the best time to come in the air with me.

Larry “The Amigo” Milian

National General Manager/Program Director
