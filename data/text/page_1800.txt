Subject: Update on Film details, Task Force conversations, etc.

Hi Patty: A few important updates. And a request for this weekend/Sunday.

 

2) We have been working with John Burklow/Dr. Collins/HHS on access to the Task Force. The
Task Force came back to us and asked us for more details about our approach, we gave them a
written description of the overall approach of documenting for history the role of the Task
Force, it’s leadership, NIH, NIAID, and Dr. Fauci. Burklow is working with us on this.

3) Could | have a ten minute phore conversation with Dr. Fauci this weekend, important—|
think—to update him on details personally.

4) We would like, if possible to start filming with Dr. Fauci this weekend. Could we film Dr.
Fauci exiting his house and going to the live truck for Sunday morning interviews and then
going back home or off to the WH. We would then match that in the film with the feed from
the truck of him sitting down and get archive from the shows he appears. We are close by. Zac
(DP, who Dr. Fauci knows) has been in complete self-quarantine for two weeks before he left
New York State and we are now here a week. He is completely good by self-quarantine rules
for above filming.

Thanks to the three of you for the work. The communication is life-saving. | have a couple of
close friends on the frontline and they asked me to relay how deeply grateful they are for the

work you are all doing.
