“The hospital is surrounded by a 'sanitary cordon’, with Carabinieri,
workers of the Red Cross and Civil Protection. Cardiology chief
Giampaolo Pasquetto arrived outside the hospital for a few minutes and
reported the results of the swabs ‘as far as I have been able to know
from my colleagues so far,’ he said. The modern structure is located
between the towns of Este and Monselice and was recently inaugurated
to serve the Euganean Hills area.”

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics said on Saturday that one
coronavirus case had been confirmed at its mobile device factory
complex in the southeastern city of Gumi, causing a shutdown of its
entire facility there until Monday morning.

Samsung Electronics, the world’s top smartphone maker, said the floor
where the infected employee worked would be shut down until the
morning of Feb. 25.

“The company has placed colleagues who came in contact with the
infected employee in self-quarantine and taken steps to have them tested
for possible infection,” Samsung said in a news release.

Samsung’s factory in Gumi accounts for a small portion of its total
smartphone production, and it makes high-end phones, mostly for the

domestic market. Samsung produces most of its smartphones in
Vietnam and India.

Gumi is close to the city of Daegu, home to a church at the center of
South Korea’s largest coronavirus outbreak.

South Korea said on Saturday that the number of people infected with
the coronavirus in the country had more than doubled to 433.

Samsung said production at its chip and display factories in other parts
of South Korea would not be affected.
