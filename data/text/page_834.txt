Subject: RE: NAS Annual Meeting Session on COVID-19 -- Information
regarding your Saturday April 25 participation

Dear all,

Thank you for agreeing to participate in a special late breaking session

on the COVID-19 pandemic at the NAS annual meeting. Knowing how
busy you are, | am sending this email in lieu of a call to prepare for the

session.

As you know, this 1s a 90 minute session which aims to provide our
audience with deeper insights into the latest developments in the
COVID-19 response. I plan to hold an engaging discussion that covers
the whole experience on dealing with this pandemic — from US to
international, to preparedness and response, the biology of the virus, the
state of diagnostic, treatment and vaccine development, and the
importance of communication.

I will begin the session by providing brief (~3 min) opening remarks
describing the circumstances of the pandemic. Then, I will introduce the
panclists and you will cach have 7 minutes to provide remarks. You
