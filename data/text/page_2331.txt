Subject: CoV collaboration with Polish Medical Research Agency

Dear Dr. Sierpinski,

Dr. Fauci referred your message to me and other NIAID colleagues with a request that we
respond on his behalf so as to avoid further delay. We certainly sympathize with your
situation, as we also are working urgently to prevent, control and manage COVID-19 in the
United States.

During his visit to NIH in 2018, I was pleased to meet Minister Szumowski and, although |
was traveling when you visited Dr. Fauci last year, | am aware that the meeting was
productive and that we remain interested in encouraging further U.S.-Poland scientific
collaboration. In part, as a result of that meeting, we are also very pleased to be planning
an NIH and ABM-sponsored clinical research training workshop in Poland later this year.

As you are likely aware, NIAID is collaborating with a number of organizations to develop
vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. We are expecting the first vaccine to start Phase | trials within the
next month. As vaccines move through Phase | testing, there may be opportunities to
collaborate.

In addition, with NIAID as the regulatory sponsor, we have initiated a randomized,
controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational antiviral

NIH-000750
