Subject: Thinking of you

 

Dear Dr. Fauci,
You have been a bulwark for me since I was a resident in the 1980s, dealing with the AIDS epidemic at LA County
General. For so many years, you have provided expert guidance in a calm, rational manner. As the Coronavirus

becomes closer and closer to a pandemic, I know you have so much on your plate (hoarse voice, no?).

I send you my best wishes to stay well yourself during these trying times, and hope that you know how much you
have meant, and continue to mean, to all physicians out there. You have given so much.

May God bless you always.
Best,

Linda Schmidt, MD
