Dear Director Fauci,

While important stores with pharmacies (Walmart, CVS, Walgreens) remain open, many
elderly folks are afraid to enter due to the mixing of young and old and the increased risk of
coronavirus exposure. | suggest that these stores designate certain hours for for those 60
years of age and older. Now that stores are reducing hours to clean and restock the stores
overnight, the best hours might be first thing in the morning. For example for Walmart, the
hours designated for those 60 and over could be 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. This could reduce their
exposure to younger people who might have the virus but who are asymptomatic (or
relatively so). This same idea could be applied to grocery stores.

Best wishes
