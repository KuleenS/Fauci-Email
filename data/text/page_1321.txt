NAC AND PIPERINE TO INHIBIT INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES
(INOS, NF KappaB, TNFalpha) INVOLVED IN ARDS

Mortality in COVID-19 patients is usually from ARDS (acute respiratory distress
syndrome) via inflammatory cytokines. Apart from N-acetylcysteine which was
found 3 years ago to elevate atrial natriuretic factor [found by Kiemer in 2001 to
zap inflammatory cytokines: iNOS, NF KappaB, and TNFalpha) now piperine in
black pepper was found to inhibit inflammatory cytokines [piperine also
dramatically increases oral bioavailability of turmeric [which has been used as a
potent antiviral]:
