Please take a look at this. We obviously will have to get clearance through HHS and White
House Leg. This is for Thursday and so we would need to submit soon.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, M.D.

Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
Department of Health and Human Services

5601 Fishers Lane

Bethesda, MD 20892-9806

Dear Dr. Fauci:

Thank you for your tremendous steadfast leadership during this pandemic and
health crisis. Our nation has not faced a crisis of this magnitude since the 1918
Spanish Flu, but we will travel this journey together and defeat this virus. In the end, the
nation will become stronger and more prepared.

Your participation is requested in a Virtual Town Hall meeting hosted by
ABC affiliate Channel 13 in Houston, Texas on Thursday, May 7, 2020 at 7:00 PM
CDT. This town hall meeting will focus on testing and guidelines for re-opening
our nation. It is scheduled to last an hour with 2 or 3 guests including yourself. Houston
is the fourth largest city in the country and your knowledge and expertise would be most
helpful in our fight to keep our infection and fatality rates low for this entire region and
the State of Texas.
