Subject: Fwd: Guidance for users of biologics in the age of Coronavirus.
Dear Tony-
| wonder if you would be willing to participate in a short piece regarding use of biologics with

looming Coronavirus for JAMA Dermatology or JAMA Internal Medicine?

Please see the email sent below to me by my colleague and collaborator Joel Gelfand from
Penn.

| understand there are fierce demands on your time but we would be happy to draft for your
approval.

Many thanks for your consideration!

All my best,
Nehal
