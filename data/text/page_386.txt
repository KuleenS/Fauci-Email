Dear Hillary,

Thanks for your email.

I am indeed looking forward to my NIH visit on Friday, and am
Still hoping I might get some time with Dr. Fauci, though I can
appreciate he might be busier than either of us expected to be
back when we first scheduled my interview with him!

Warm regards,

Jason
