Dear Zhu,
The COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented threat not only to global public health but
also to economic and political stabilty. Uncertainty about the origin of COVID-19 pandemic is
causing friction worldwide, particularly between China and the United States. There is
agreement that the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2 originated in a bat. There is also a high level
of confidence that the virus was not deliberately modified in any laboratory. What we do not
know is the answers to two questions: (1) whether a precursor virus circulated in the human
population before it evolved to become a pandemic virus and_ (2) whether a precursor virus _
adapted to humans by first | passing through another animal. 4]
