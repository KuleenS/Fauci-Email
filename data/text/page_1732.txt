Subject: Question from Georgetown

Dear Tony:

I know that you are busy 7/24 with the current crisis.

BUT I have a question for you or for one of your colleagues.

 

Please let me know.

Meanwhile there are not adequate ways to thank you for all you do.

I should have seen that when you were my attending while you were at Cornell as a Visiting
Professor Professor around
