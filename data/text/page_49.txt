Subject: Zinc gluconate by inhalation for early coronavirus in ‘elderly?

 

Dr Fauci,

Since the elderly’s response to pulmonary coronavirus infection may be impaired, especially in those with a chronic
disorder, is there any information re: delivering by inhalation, low concentrations of a Zinc salt. Is there a potential
rationale in early coronavirus infection to try to minimize serious pneumonia, were such inhalation shown to be
reasonably safe?

Thank you,
