Tony,

Would you be willing to have your statement “we are in the middle of influenza season...” included in
the Academy’s online Practice Matters email Thursday going out to all members (attributed to you)
along with a link to the CDC website devoted to Coronavirus?

Thanks,

Tom

Tom:

Right now nothing specific to communicate except that we are still in the middle
of an influenza season and the things that we do to prevent spread of flu (i.e.
hand washing, social distancing from crowds) are the same things that we would
do if we have transmissions of nCoV here.

Best,
Tony
