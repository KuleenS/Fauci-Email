Read this! Thisis unsettling if true efficient spreading in asymptomatics with negative test. Is that
possible? Report is intermittent shedding is that true or artifact of poor sample collection or lack of
sensitivity of pcr testing?

From Dr Eva Lee GaTech

“Means of spread A study from AMA confirmed many of the parameters assumed in our
models:

- A 20-year old infected with COVID-19 left Wuhan and went on infecting 5 relatives. When
they tested positive, she was finally isolated, but tested negative still, and later tested
positive, and remain normal on chest CT with no fever, stomach or respiratory symptoms
(cough or sore throat as late as Fen 11 (time of the papert study duration).

So spreading and its wide scope is unavoidable because there exists these very healthy
individuals who can spread effectively -- even during incubation period -- while they
remain perfectly healthy. It also showcases difficulty in testing -- negative test — may not
be the end of it. “
