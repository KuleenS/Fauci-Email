and the American people, but participation in hearings cannot continue to divert resources
from our response effort.

This pause is effective immediately. It is intended to last for three weeks, through the end
of March, though we will reevaluate if it needs to be extended at a later date.

Importantly, as noted above, this does not only include witnesses for hearings that are
explicitly focused on coronavirus, but also, to be determined on a case-by-case basis,
witnesses and agencies who are playing vital roles on the Task Force or the broader
Administration response, whether or not the hearing topic is coronavirus.

Therefore, please do not accept hearing invitations from Congress for hearings through
March if you believe they meet the above criteria. If you already have hearings confirmed
that you believe fits this criteria, please notify us immediately. You will likely have to
postpone those hearings.

Four corners leadership offices have already been notified of this policy.

Please reach out to OMB if you have any questions, and we will be happy to work with you
as we implement this policy.

Thank you.
