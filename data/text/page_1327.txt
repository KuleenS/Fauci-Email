Tony,

Hope all is well and that you are staying safe and healthy.

 

Cc ____}. Our plan is to batch and send these to Hilary, Patty, and Kim on Thursdays/Fridays
each week, unless there is a time sensitivity to them. For the time-sensitive requests, | will flag them for
you (after a couple levels of filtering).

So, that said, |am reaching out to flag the following time-sensitive items for your awareness and sharing
with the remainder of the Task Force, as appropriate. You'll note that both of these are yours, so this
email may be unnecessary. If so, apologies for adding to your (what much be crazy) inbox.

Item 1: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Strategic Plan for COVID-19 Research
(NEW)

Activity Type: Strategic Plan

Summary: Anew strategic research plan from the National Institutes of Health aims to build on
— and accelerate — new and existing research efforts to prevent, diagnose, and treat COVID-19,
as well as understand the underlying causative agent of this disease, severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The Plan prioritizes research to improve fundamental
knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 disease, develop diagnostics and assays,
characterize and test therapeutics, as well as develop safe and effective vaccines targeted toward
decreasing disease incidence, mitigating morbidity, and prevention mortality from this disease.
