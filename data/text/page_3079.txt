He would love to do this but our schedule kas been changing literally by the minute - so much so that we have had
to cancel meetings, events and 2 trips he had scheduled for out of town last week. So - while he would love to do
this and would make himself available...it might be better to do later when things hopefully quiet down a bit.

Defer to you tho as to when you want to do your event. Happy to chat more ....
