Dear Dr Fauci,

I heard this idea on a radio interview with Laurie Garrett this morning — how about
getting your committee (or one of the government health agencies) to produce a
series of short YouTube videos on how to combat the coronavirus: such things as
proper handwashing technique, when to wear a mask, how to ride the subway
safely, etc, etc. I think this would be an excellent way to reach the public in the
digital age (provided that Mike Pence doesn’t try to turn them into campaign ads
for Donald Trump), and I strongly urge you to give the strategy serious
consideration. | know I would watch them and I’m sure millions of other people
would too.

Sincerely,

NIH-001075
