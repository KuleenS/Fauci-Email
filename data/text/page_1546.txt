You bet.

Joe — Have an enormous request — for help or counsel.

 

My CEO, Dave Ricks, would like to speak with Dr. Fauci in this regard (given his role at the
Institute). | know that is a tall order — but underscores the importance.

| did reach out to Dr. Fauci's Chief but received an automated reply indicated he was
behind in email — any thoughts in the regard greatly appreciated....
