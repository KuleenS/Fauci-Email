Dear Dr. Fauci,

| am writing to inquire about your willingness to address the Society of
International Business Fellows (SIBF) as part of our webinar series. SIBFisa
distinguished organization of nearly 1600 global executives and senior leaders.
Our C-level global membership would appreciate getting your perspectives on the
coronavirus outbreak. We are open to topics which could include....What we
know and don’t know...As business and community leaders what SIBF members
can do to prepare and educate their employees...Safety of travel, etc.

We were thinking the webinar could be approximately 30 minutes in length (15

minutes of remarks followed by 15 minutes of Q&A). SIBF’s Communications
Manager could work with someone on your team to set-up the webinar. SIBFisa
