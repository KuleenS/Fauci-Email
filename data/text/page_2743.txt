Hi, Patty -

Exec Sec would like Dr. Fauci’s opinion on whether Dr. Collins should accept the attached invitation to
speak at an upcoming Coronavirus Preparedness Summit & Workshop being held this June in
Washington, DC. The conference is being organized by Syllabusx, a group of “international specialists in
public health and emergency planning events and disaster recovery conferences.”

Given the nature of the conference topics, do you concur with recommending Dr. Collins decline the

invitation and refer to CDC?

Thanks for your input.
