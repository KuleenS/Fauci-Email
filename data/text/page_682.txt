Subject: FOR ASF REVIEW: Draft PR re: launch of ACTT 2 COVID treatment study

 

 

Hi Dr. Fauci,

Please find attached for your review a draft press release to announce the launch of the ACTT 2
COVID-19 treatment trial (remdesivir and baricitinib). Below is your draft quote:

“We now have solid data showing that remdesivir diminishes to a modest degree the
time to recovery for people hospitalized with COVID-19,” said NIAID Director Anthony S.
Fauci, M.D. “ACTT 2 will examine if adding an anti-inflammatory agent to the remdesivir

regimen can provide additional benefit for patients, including improving mortality outcomes.”

The trial may start enrollment tomorrow.
