Do you think you might have time in your schedule to speak to the National Economist Club this
month? We would love to have you speak during the week of March 16-20.

Our luncheons typically take place at the Chinatown Garden Restaurant, 618 H St. NW, with lunch at
noon and your presentation from 12:30 p.m. til 1:30 p.m. Talks are normally on the record and open to
the press, unless you request otherwise.

Thank you for your consideration.
Best regards,

Emily
