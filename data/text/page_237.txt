I am drowning right now. However, I am always happy to speak with you. Cannot do it until | dig out from

Dr. Fauci,

| was most pleased to hear Sec. Azar’s commitment to “radical transparency.” In that vein, I would like to interview
you about COVID-19 for a Science magazine article I am preparing.

Thanks in advance,
