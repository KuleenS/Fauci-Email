Subject: Meeting to Assess Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine candidates for risk of enhanced disease

Dear Doctor Fauci,

lam writing to you as a member of the SPEAC project which CEPI has funded to assist with the
evaluation of the safety of vaccines in their portfolio. As part of this effort, we are assisting
with developing preclinical and clinical testing criteria to evaluate the risk of enhanced disease
following vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine candidates. As you know, this had been an issue
with some prior SARS vaccine candidates.

We are convening a two day virtual meeting of experts via video conference next week on
March 12 and 13 between 8 am and 1 pm Eastern time each day. Participants in the meeting
are shown in the attached agenda but include Paul Henri Lambert from Geneva and Barney
Graham from NIH. The meeting will actively involve the participants on the agenda the first day
