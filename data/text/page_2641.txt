The remaining passengers will
remain under quarantine for 14
days.

Passengers arriving to Travis Air
Force Base will be housed in the
same facility as evacuees who
arrived from Wuhan earlier this
month, a spokesperson for the
base told CNN. New evacuees will
be kept in a separate area of the
Westwind Inn on the base, the
spokesperson said.

Before the announcement about
the infected flight passengers,
some Americans aboard the
Diamond Princess said they didn't
want to take a chance being
evacuated for fear they would be
subject to possible infection.

Sacramento resident Matthew
Smith told CNN affiliate KOVR
that he would rather deal with
issues in Japan than be evacuated
and quarantined in the United
States.

"We decided we would just face
whatever consequences here rather
than exposing ourselves to that
situation," Smith told the
affiliate."It kind of didn't make
any sense if the us was fearful that
these were infected people which
is why they're going to quarantine
them for another 2 weeks to have
thrown them all together"

Smith's wife Katherine Codekas
was met with some surprise when
she told authorities that she and
her husband weren't going to go
with the other American evacuees,
KOVR reported.
