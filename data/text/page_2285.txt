Subject: Curevac, meeting with President Trump

Dear Dr. Fauci,

I am the new CEO of CureVac. Would be good to update you on our efforts on
Covid-19 vaccine here in Europe. This 1s a global challenge, we should learn from
each other to act fast and avoid mistakes. I do not accept any barriers from Stephane
Bancel just for competitive reasons. Happy to call or to meet personally.

Best regards, Ingmar Hoerr
