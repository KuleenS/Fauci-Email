Hi Dr. Fauci:

I have been a long time admirer of you in the field of modern medicine.
This question I have relates to the current Coronavirus circulating
around the world. For many years | have informed people that the ways
a virus can be passed from person to person isn’t always by a sneeze,
cough or by touching someones face with their hands. Has anyone in
your medical community thought that 1f someone were smoking and
was an infected person that once they expel the smoke particles into the
air that those micro smoke particles may contain viruses that were in the
respiratory system of an infected person. Everyone I mention this to
don’t believe that this is possible. What are your thoughts on this
matter? If so why hasn’t the medical community warned the public
about this possibility as I stay away from all establishments that allow
smoking on their premises.

Thank you,

Daniel Ga
