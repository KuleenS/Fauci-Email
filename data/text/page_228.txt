Tony,
Obviously you are swamped and the country is likely safer for it! | wanted to be sure you were up to

date on our efforts re COVID-19.

 

We have had discussions with our partners at BARDA and have had contact with the White House. 7

 

In the near future we will have a cocktail of antibodies ready for testing and we would be delighted to
work with you and the NIH if that makes sense.

If you would like to discuss further, please call my cell at anytime.
