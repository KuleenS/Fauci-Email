Dear Dr. Fauci

| understand that South Korea has been administering Hydroxl Chloroquine, a treatment
for Malaria, to her citizens that have contracted Coronavirus. Is America considering this
drug to help lessen the symptoms of this virus? This drug may not prevent anyone from
getting ill, but may be a viable treatment to speed the recovery of individual afflicted with

this disease.

Respectfully,
