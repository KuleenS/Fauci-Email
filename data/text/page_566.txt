question for you regarding info I was able to find at this
site https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

Regarding data this site reports, among many things, and as
one scrolls down, that the 'number of active cases' reported
today 1s 57,228 and the number of these that are 'serious or
critical’ is 12,064. In a worst case scenario, and taking the
12,064 as the numerator and dividing it by a denominator of
57,228, we get 21.08, or about 21%, much higher that the 1%
based on total deaths over total cases so far. Of course this is not
fair but my question is this: can we know better how many of
the patients (cases) who are 'serious or critical’ and still being
treated will recover?

Thanks much for any reply-
