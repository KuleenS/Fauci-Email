Hey Dr Fauci,

Am wondering if you would be interested in having a chat with us in NZ, over Zoom, as we all sit in our
houses fighting Coronavirus

| do a podcast which is normally live streamed but we currently have a country wide lockdown and lots
of us have moved our gear home to continue providing content for people who are stuck in their homes

the US is like out big brother, we love you guys and would like to connect in solidarity about COVID19 so
I'm hoping that maybe you could find us sometime to have a chat over the internet. Some content
would also help us give some more content to Kiwi's who have gotten to the end of Netflix ;)

Find out more about the podcast at www.theDOC.nz and more about me

at www. patbrittenden.com/a bout

Can make anytime happen, fingers crossed we'll hear back from ‘someone’.
