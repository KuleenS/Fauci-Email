Hello Dr. Fauci and Patricia,

I hope you're both doing well.

I'm reaching out to see if Dr. Fauci could be available for an interview with Anderson Cooper on
Monday for his CNN digital program, Full Circle. Full Circle is an interesting platform because
it allows us to take live viewer questions. This taped interview would air on Tuesday at SPM and
Anderson could tape tomorrow in the 4PM hour or after 5:45PM.

The topic is of course the Coronavirus.

Thank you for considering this request!

Sophie Varon

Editorial Producer, CNN AC360
