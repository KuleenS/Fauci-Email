Sorry that | got to this so late. | have been swamped. | just read
your story in Science. It is unfortunate that they did not interview the
patient. Obviously, this changes the conclusion of the paper. My
comment: “There’s no doubt after reading [the NEJM] paper that
asymptomatic transmission is occurring” was made because there has
been a lot of discussion among Chinese investigators that
asymptomatic infection is occurring in Wuhan City and Hubei Province,
yet no publication came out and said this. Since this was the first
publication supposedly documenting this phenomenon, that is why |
referred to the paper and made my comment. It is unfortunate that
this error was published, but it still does not really change anything.
Rather than rely on rumors, this evening | telephoned one of my
colleagues in China who is a highly respected infectious diseases
scientist and health official. He said that he is convinced that there is
asymptomatic infection and that some asymptomatic people are
transmitting infection. The NEJM paper may be incorrect, but
according to reputable Chinese scientists, my statement is correct.
Having said that, | have been saying for some time that even if
asymptomatic infection occurs, it is very unlikely to be a major driver of
the outbreak since most transmissions occur from someone who is
asymptomatic.
