Dear Dr. Fauci,

I am thoracic oncologist at the NCI. I wanted to commend you on your tremendous (and
exhausting) job on managing and stcering our country with the COVID-19 pandemic. If you
need additional any personnel to help with any clinical or non-clinical aspects of the current
situation, Iam more than happy to help. As you know we have scaled down our clinical
operations and trials at the NIH CC and so | have more time.

Best regards,

Azam Ghafoor, MD
