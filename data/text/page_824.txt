hydroxychloroquine and some antimalaria drugs usage, it was suggested that those who were alleged
to have had some benefits had mild symptoms of covid 19. | know some clinical trials have shown
hydroxychloroquine not to be effective in the treatment of covid 19 in very ill patients. However, my
hypothesis is, are the low death rates in Africa linked to the fact that malaria is very prevelant in Africa,
and lots of Africans take antimalarial drugs, making them less susceptible to covid 19, hence the low
death rate. Is there a similar trend in other countries where malaria is prevalent? Is there an unintended
benefit of taking antimalarial drug (or other medication) before covid infection, or at the onset, making
people less susceptible to covid19.

As | said, this is based on anecdotal observations.
