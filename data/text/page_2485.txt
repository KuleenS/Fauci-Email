(ECMOs are extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines, which oxygenate the blood when the
lungs fail.)

Who paid for all of this?

The government made it clear: testing is free. And if it was Covid-19, when your insurance ended, the
state picked up everything.

In the U.S., that’s a barrier to speed. People think: “If | see my doctor, it’s going to cost me $100. If | end
up in the I.C.U., what’s it going to cost me?” That'll kill you. That’s what could wreak havoc. This is where
universal health care coverage and security intersect. The U.S. has to think this through.

What about the nonmedical response?

It was nationwide. There was this tremendous sense of, “We’ve got to help Wuhan,” not “Wuhan got us
into this.” Other provinces sent 40,000 medical workers, many of whom volunteered.

In Wuhan, our special train pulled in at night, and it was the saddest thing — the big intercity trains roar
right through, with the blinds down.

We got off, and another group did. | said, “Hang on a minute, | thought we were the only ones allowed
to get off.” They had these little jackets and a flag — it was a medical team from Guangdong coming in
to help.

How did people in Wuhan eat if they had to stay indoors?

Fifteen million people had to order food online. It was delivered. Yes, there were some screw-ups. But
one woman said to me: “Every now and again there’s something missing from a package, but | haven’t
lost any weight.”

Lots of government employees were reassigned?

From all over society. A highway worker might take temperatures, deliver food or become a contact
tracer. In one hospital, | met the woman teaching people how to gown up. | asked, “You’re the infection
control expert?” No, she was a receptionist. She’d learned.
