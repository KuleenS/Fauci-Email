Dear Tony:

Quick updates, we have partnered with Story Syndicate/John Hoffman
(who was in charge of First In Human and Alzheimer’s and Obesity
projects) on the film about your life. This will help us make sure that
next year this film has maximum impact and we carry the message
widely of “men serving men” and public health. NIH Communications
head John Burklow, and the main office, knows and is very supportive
and excited about the potential impact. They have worked super
closely with John in the past.

We are putting in the request for filming with the Vice President's

office and we will work with Patty to figure out how to film your work
and NIAID’s work on COVID-19, which is important. But safety and
