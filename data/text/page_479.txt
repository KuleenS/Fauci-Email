Dick:

Transmission is definitely by respiratory droplet. Still unclear about aerosol
transmission although there are anecdotal reports that this occurs similar to what
we saw in individual episodes with SARS back in 2002-2003. Almost certainly
contact transmission occurs with hand to mucosa (mouth, eyes, nasal mucosa).
Unclear about fomites, doorknobs, etc. Virus can live for a couple of hours on
certain inanimate objects. Virus definitely isolated from stool and urine, but not
sure of role in transmission. No information about Transmission to fetus.
Children have very low rate of infection. No good serologic test at this point
although they are rapidly being developed.

Best,
Tony
