I’ve attached an “event rundown” for the Harvard Forum Webcast, which is scheduled
from 11:40-1pm on Monday 3/2—a moderated panel discussion. This is a document
prepared by the event organizers outlining the run of show, noting what questions the
moderator will pose, and some suggested points the organizers thought you might touch
onin your answers.

Although the organizers prepared this document following a planning call, they have made
it clear that the “talking points” in this document are of course not a script. | have taken
their document and highlighted where you appear. | have also added some comments.
Let me know what you think. There are no slides for this event.

Let me know if you would like to discuss further over the weekend or if you'd like anything
for preparation.

Sincerely,
Andrea
