‘activate’ them, might these ammonia fumes be able to protect us against the
coronavirus?

Admittedly, too much ammonia gas can be very irritating (and even fatal, as in
WW!), but evidently pcople

seem to survive and thrive at the just-noticeable gas levels being recommended here.
If there is some potential

lung damage from ammonia gas, that might be prevented by taking (freeze-dried)
stinging nettles leaf, a widely

recognized lung-cleaning supplement that is recommended by Naturopathic
Doctors. But it would seem that

the potential benefits of limiting the spread of the coronavirus in our entire
population far outweighs the risks

of lung damage. Since most homes already have bottles of ammonia (in their
laundry area), this preventive

strategy could be implemented immediately, and would provide the public with
the satisfaction of feeling

they are doing 'their part' in combatting this pandemic ...and protecting themselves
and their loved-ones.

NOTE: I am NOT a medical doctor, but an electronic systems engineer and scientist
(who takes systems

engineering as a license to meddle in all things), but I was the first male family
member in 4 generations who

did NOT become a pharmacist or physician. I'm emailing my (old address) CV
separately, but the email and

cell phone number -- still reach me as I'm
[__}, and then plan to

retum to my new home in[____"®)@ (IF there's no travel restrictions in force)!
I can be reached via email

or cell phone to explain this preventive strategy further. Meanwhile, good luck on
all your efforts to contain

this pandemic; the next four weeks or so will be critical!
