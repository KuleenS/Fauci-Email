Dear Dr. Fauci,

Thank you very much for courageous and tireless efforts to defeat
the coronavirus pandemic.

One of the statements attributed to you puzzled me.

The article

quotes you as Saying,

"I've said many times if you just leave it alone and left the virus to its own
devices then it'll go way up and it'll come down naturally over a period of
several weeks," Fauci said. "Unfortunately for our colleagues in Italy, in
France, and certainly in China, that's what happened."
