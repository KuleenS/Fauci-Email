if not already there. The reason to say this is that when several countries have widespread transmissions, then spill-
over to other countries is inevitable since one cannot shut out the rest of the world and so you can expect increasing
world-wide transmissions among progressively more countries. In essence, you will be experiencing a pandemic.
We are not quite there yet, but we are getting disturbingly close. It will soon be a matter of semantics regarding
who would be willing to call it since it is not a mathematically precise definition. I am not so sure that WHO will
have the will to declare this a "pandemic" before a number of respected epidemiologists around the world start
referring publicly to it as a pandemic regardless of what WHO does or docs not declare. WHO will likely be behind
the curve here and will wait until it 1s patently obvious what we are dealing with.

Hope that this is helpful.
Best,

Tony
