Subject: CoV collaboration with Polish Medical Research Agency

Dear Doctor Fauci,

| hope this e -mail is finding you well and your efforts in fight against
Coronavirus epidemics is giving some effects. As you know in Poland we have
currently 15 cases of CoV infection and we are also fighting mostly with
general society worries than epidemics. We would like also to take part in
research on CoV vaccine or drug and Polish Medical Research Agency is
planning to start financing some project on it as soon as possible. Both polish
medical universities and institutes are fully prepared to take part in such
project.

On behalf of Polish Minister of Health Prof. Lukasz Szumowski | would like to
kindly ask you for some support and collaboration options with NIH in this
very delicate issue. Maybe NIH can take some advisory role in our scientific
project or Polish scientists may take some part in your work bilaterally.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
Radostaw Sierpinski MD, PhD

President of Medical Research Agency in Poland
