Would you potentially be available for a short video interview sometime
between 10am - 7pm EST tomorrow? Alternatively, would you be free
sometime between 12pm - 2pm or 5pm - 7pm EST on Monday?

Look forward to hearing back and we'd be honored to have your voice in
the story.

Here's a brief overview of Frame:

Frame is a newsmagazine that publishes interactive documentaries made
for mobile phones. Every Frame story tells a compelling, human story that
helps shine a light on a major social or political issue.

Frame stories include interactive features throughout, from maps to
timelines, that allow viewers to engage more deeply with the piece. Our
stories are delivered through a messaging platform that allows subscribers
to have conversations with our journalists and subscribe to news updates
on topics they want to follow, all through SMS. Frame has been covered
by TechCrunch, Poynter, and Journalism.co.uk, and our investors include
Snap Inc.'s Yellow Accelerator.
