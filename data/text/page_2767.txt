Dr. Fauci,

| wanted to reach out to see if epiqar (https://epiqar.com/) can help your efforts with the
Coronavirus- we are the only system in the world built for remote surgical help & interactive
emergency surgeon support over the web browser.

epiqar has created the most advanced surgical video collaboration technology, allowing
surgeons to consult and train remotely on a low-cost and easy-to-use online surgical
collaboration platform and Cloud-archiving system built for the operating room. With the
outbreak of Coronavirus, this has become more vital as surgeon mobility and access to critical
surgical spaces in need of more help are severely limited, and specialists will not risk entering
Spreading viral hot zones.

Patient care isn't just a concern with the virus itself, but with the host of medical issues facing
patients that will no longer be treated by local specialists easily, and facing caregivers: surgeon
involvement from around the world is needed urgently.

Although epigar is an American company, our rollout in recent months has been in

France, making selected French institutions the most prepared in the world for remote video
care. We obviously weren't anticipating the Coronavirus and now we're dedicated to delivering
our technology to where the world needs it asap.

epiqar's parent company ENGAUGE (https://eng.us/) is a state-of-the-art online healthcare
company for surgeon training and has served clients such as Johnson & Johnson, Intuitive
Surgical, and many other of the world largest & smallest medical device companies.
ENGAUGE has helped surgeons all over the world have access to secure online training that
has improved their understanding of the innovations in robotics and many of the latest surgical
techniques and medical devices for best patient care.

I've linked a whitepaper below with details of the system's use. Please let me know if you would
like to speak further and/or need anything additional.

Thanks,

NIH-001938
