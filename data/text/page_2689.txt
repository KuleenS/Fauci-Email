Subject: RE: Larry, does NIH have a single point person through which all Coronavirus

intel bubbles up?

Larry:

Thanks for the note.
The person who

usually subs for me when | cannot be on a call or at a meeting is Hilary Marston.
She is up to speed on virtually all this stuff and is the name that you should send
to Paul. You can tell Paul that he should channel everything through me and |
can turf to Hilary when necessary and appropriate. Hilary is right here in my
office and is very close to me.

Best,

Tony
