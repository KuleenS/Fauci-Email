Subject: HHS COVID-19 Response - alignment of OPDIV/STAFDIV Efforts

 

 

 

 

 

Dear ASPR Colleagues,

We are at a critical juncture in our nation’s response to COVID-19. As we pivot from
containment of the virus to mitigation of its impacts, it is imperative that HHS moves
swiftly, transparently, and in a unified manner to protect lives and save Americans. The
Secretary has charged my office to lead efforts across the Department to prepare and
defend our health care system during the novel coronavirus outbreak through the
Health Care System Resilience Task Force.

To date, this task force has engaged with public and private sector stakeholders to
broadly identify efforts that can be taken to help ensure preparedness in response to a
domestic COVID-19 outbreak, and more importantly their gaps, challenges, and
potential areas of need from the federal government. Now, we must build on that
knowledge to expedite and execute a whole of HHS response to support protection of
the health care system that spans public health, health care, and human services.

Please join Dr. Kevin Yeskey, ASPR’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for
Preparedness and Response, and Dr. Nancy Messonnier, CDC’s Director of the National
Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, on Wednesday, March 4 from 9:00
AM - 10:15 AM, at the O’Neill House Office Building for a working session to align
current activities and next steps to be executed as part of a coordinated HHS response
to COVID-19.
