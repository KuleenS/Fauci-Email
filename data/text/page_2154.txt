Dear Tony:

amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research will be postponing our Capitol Hill Briefing,
"Ending the HIV/AIDS Pandemic: Lessons Learned for the Coronavirus Outbreak” planned
for Thursday, March 26th, due ta the declaration of a National Emergency in our country.

Once the coronavirus public health crisis abates, amfAR will reschedule the briefing and
hope that you will be able to speak as planned. At that meeting, you and several other of
our nation's leading health officials will address two pandemics - AIDS and COVID-19. and
the lessons learned from fighting both of these diseases. We will very much look forward to
hearing your perspectives about global initiatives for ending AIDS and the work done to
eradicate the coronavirus pandemic. We know your remarks will help provide a roadmap for
ending HIV and other infectious disease threats now and in the years ahead.

| was proud to see the contributions of the US Public Health Service highlighted in today's
WH briefing. You did an excellent job with your remarks.

Thanks for your work and dedication to safeguarding and advancing global health. Hope we
get a chance to catch up soon.

Sincerely,

Susan
