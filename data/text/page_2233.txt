Subject: UV light for COVID-19 prevention

Thank you for all your hard work trying to deal with this horrible pandemic. Please
consider ways to get UV light cleaning devices throughout the U.S. that they are
currently using in Wuhan, China to attempt to contain this virus. Closed schools and
sports venues can be cleaned with UV light while workers wear PPE and sunglasses
to protect themselves. This pandemic could be seen as an opportunity to help
prevent the spread of other contagious diseases by implementing rational public
policy such as UV cleaning when schools and sporting events have concluded. It
may also help "flatten the curve" and hopefully rebuild consumer confidence so we
can resume activities such as travel and commerce that is vital for the healthy of not
only our economy but our citizens.

Thank you again for your work and your time.
Sincerely,

Dr. David Levi
