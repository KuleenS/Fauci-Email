Subject: Thank you, sir

Dear Dr. Fauci,

Being a freelance illustrator, I am trying to keep myself productive during this
life-altering pandemic by doing a series of COVID-19 inspired drawings.

This is my latest, that I call: "My Personal Superhero."

I dedicated it to you like this: "In his own, quiet way, he is a BadAss:
Disseminating info about this disease calmly and, always, backed by science.”
