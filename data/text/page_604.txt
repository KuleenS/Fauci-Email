Subject: COVID-19

  

NBC online asked, “What is NIAID’s position on whether the SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in
asymptomatic people?”

| would propose that we send a response to Jacqueline attributed to ASF:

Early case reports indicate in certain circumstances SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in asymptomatic
people. We do not know the extent to which asymptomatic transmission is impacting the outbreak.
However, we know that people with symptoms are usually the main driver of outbreaks of other
respiratory diseases.
