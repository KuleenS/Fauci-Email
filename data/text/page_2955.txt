Subject: NTV Broadcasting Interview Request

Mr. Fauci, my name is Murat, ! am a producer of “Week Summary” for NTV Broadcasting
company.

We would like to film a brief interview with you about coronavirus, and different hypotheses
about its appearance. We want to solve the problem with mass disinformation about this
virus, and need a professional opinion.

Will it be possible to do this at 6 or 7" of February?

Best regards,
Seferbekov Murat
