When I! see Dr. Anthony Fauci on the TV screen
explaining expertly

everything we need to know about the
coronavirus pandemic, | find myself thinking
back to his father, Stephen Fauci, whose
drugstore our family relied on back in the 1950s.

Steve Fauci was the neighborhood pharmacist.

The Fauci Pharmacy stood on the southwest
corner of 13 th Ave. and 83 rd St., in the Dyker
Heights section of Brooklyn, diagonally across
from the Shrine Church of St. Bernadette. We
lived two blocks away on 85th.
