Subject: Seeking Dr. Fauci for coronavirus webinar

 

Patricia:

| hope you are doing well. Dr. Fauci has been a wonderful speaker for us in the past, and
I’m reaching out to him today for a discussion on coronavirus.

When there are major news stories, we often will try to do a live webinar on the topic with
a leading expert or two.
