the persistence of donor NAM-NK in peripheral blood up to day 7-10 (day
7 range 2-55% donor NK cells; Figure 1), as well as enhanced in vivo
proliferation (median Ki67 99%). In addition, the enhanced expression of
the homing receptor CD62L correlated with trafficking to bone marrow
and lymph nodes in vivo as confirmed by flow cytometry of biopsied
tissues at day 4.

Conclusions: Cellular therapy using GDA-201 with monoclonal antibodies
was safe, and demonstrated early evidence of clinical activity in heavily
pre-treated pts with advanced NHL and MM. Laboratory studies show that
the GDA-201 product shows better persistence. Larger phase || studies are
warranted.
