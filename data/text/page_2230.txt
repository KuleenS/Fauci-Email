Background: NK cells have the capacity to kill tumor targets and potential
In cancer therapy. Limitations include specificity, persistence after infusion
and how to maximize NK cell activity in vivo. We report results of a Phase 1
clinical trial of GDA-201, a cellular product composed of Natural killer (NK)
cells from healthy donors expanded ex-vivo with nicotinamide (NAM) and
IL-15, a unique ex vivo activation strategy to induce persistence. Prior in
vitro studies and pre-clinical models demonstrated that NAM-exposed NK
cells exhibit augmented resistance against exhaustion and improved killing
function, proliferation, and organ trafficking. We report safety and
preliminary efficacy from a phase | trial of GDA-201 in patients (pts) with
relapsed or refractory (R/R) NHL or MM.

Methods: Following donor apheresis, CD3-depleted mononuclear cells
were cultured for 14-16 days with NAM (S5mM) and IL-15 (20ng/ml),
resulting in a 40-fold increase in NK cells and increased expression of
CD62L from 2.9% to 21%. GDA-201 contained ~98% NK cells, and CD3
content was maintained at <0.5% (<5x10:/kg/dose). Pts with R/R B-cell
NHL or MM received cyclophosphamide (400mg/mzlV x 3d) and
fludarabine (30 mg/m: /d IV x 3d), followed by two doses of GDA-201
(Days 0 and 2) and low-dose IL-2 (6 million units sc). Pts with NHL or MM
received rituximab (375 mg/m) or elotuzumab (10 mg/kg), respectively, x
3 weekly infusions to enhance NK cell targeting through antibody-
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).

Results: 25 pts were enrolled:11 with NHL (5 follicular, 5 diffuse large cell
lymphoma, 1 mantle cell lymphoma) and 14 with MM, in 3 cohorts of
escalating GDA-201 dose; 14 pts received the maximum target dose
(median 1.7 x 10scells/kg, range 1.6-2.0 x 10¢cells/kg). There were no dose
limiting toxicities. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia (n=2), increased
creatinine, hyponatremia, pulmonary edema; all events were transient.
There were no neurotoxic events, confirmed CRS, GVHD or marrow aplasia.
One patient died of E-coli sepsis.

Among 11 NHL pts, there were 7 CR and 1 PR with an overall response rate
of 72%. Median duration of response is 11 months (CR patients) and 3
months (PR patients). In MM patients, 1 patient with extramedullary
disease had CR and 4 had SD with median duration 2.5 months. In our
previous study using overnight activated NK cells, persistence 7 days after
adoptive transfer was limited. Using GDA-201, flow cytometry confirmed
