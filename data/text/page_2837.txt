Subject: CNN Anderson Cooper Full Circle Request- Dr. Anthony Fauci

Hello Dr. Fauci and Patricia,

I hope you're both doing well.

I'm reaching out to see if Dr. Fauci could be available for an interview with
Anderson Cooper on Monday for his CNN digital program, Full Circle. Full Circle
is an interesting platform because it allows us to take live viewer questions. This
taped interview would air on Tuesday at SPM and Anderson could tape tomorrow in
the 4PM hour or after 5:45PM.

The topic 1s of course the Coronavirus.
Thank you for considering this request!
Sophie Varon
