Dear Dr. Fauci,

First of all, thank you so much for the wonderful job you are doing regarding the information on the coronavirus.
You were excellent with Chris Wallace!

Is it possible to give facts on the FLU - number of people who have had it and how many have died - during the past
month? I wonder if that might perhaps slow down the media frenzy.

Many thanks for your consideration of my question.
Best regards,

Candace Gunn
