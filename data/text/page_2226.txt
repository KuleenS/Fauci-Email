Dr. Fauci,

I'm not a medical professional. I'm just someone who is paying attention to what is going on.

I'm hearing that in many cases people have died because they developed pneumonia due to
coronavirus. Since there is no coronavirus vaccine and won't be for a while can pneumonia be
prevented by getting pneumonia vaccination? To me, that seems like a very logical course. | was
actually trying to get that vaccine but | was turned away because | do not have any medical history
showing that | need it and I'm not 65 yet. Could this be some way to lower the death while working on
the vaccine? | have sent this to a few other places/people but not sure I'm reaching the right people,
so I'm hoping it will reach you or someone in your office that will read it:).

If we can not cure the virus yet, maybe we could get in front of it and prevent it from being deadly...
Just a thought.
