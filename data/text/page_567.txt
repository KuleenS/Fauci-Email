David:

Thanks for the note. | hope that allis well with you. Although allogeneic/semi-
allogeneic blood transfusions could be an interesting approach to serious COVID-
19 disease, there are a number of existing drugs such as remdesivir (nucleotide
analogue) and Kaletra (protease inhibitor) that have some pre-clinical activity
against the virus and these are now being tested in randomized clinical trials.

Best regards,
Tony

It has been some time since we last spoke, but this current
catastrophe has provoked my thinking about possible

therapeutic interventions that could be immediately
employed -- in advance of therapies/vaccines that will take
