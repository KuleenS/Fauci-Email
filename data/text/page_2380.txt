Dr. Anthony S. Fauci;

| have attached an article | read online about a doctor in Taiwan treating patients with Coronavirus, with
a combination of anti-viral drugs. Since the treatment helped the patients, | was wondering why they
are not treating patients in the United States with those drugs.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Barbara Eagan
