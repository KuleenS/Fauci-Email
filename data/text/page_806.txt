Subject: Requesting your assistance: Draft NIAID Statement for May 12 Senate HELP Hearing

Dr. Fauci:

In preparation for the upcoming May 12" COVID-19 hearing of the Senate Health,
Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (Chair: Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-TN),
we have drafted the attached NIAID testimony, building on your prior testimony
on COVID-19. Drs. Giroir, Hahn, and Redfield also have been invited to the
hearing.

We expect that your testimony will be included as an insert to an HHS-wide
testimony. At the request of NIH OD, we have incorporated into the draft COVID-
19 activities across NIH.

The testimony has been reviewed by the Divisions and Drs. Lane, Harper,
Marston, and Lerner, as well as Courtney Billet, Greg Folkers, Martin Johnson,

and Laurie Doepel.

NIH OLPA has asked to receive your testimony for clearance by tomorrow, if
possible.

Thank you for your help.
