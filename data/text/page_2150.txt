Dr. Fauci,

I am not sure you are aware, but there is already a point-of-care
solution available for Coronavirus, and the Denver newsrooms have
been reporting about it. 9News and FoxNews are all reporting about
Aytu BioScience of Englewood, Colorado. The kits have already been
used in China, and are immediately available to assist burden the
testing time and backlog. Who do we need to inform of this already
available option? Thank you.

Regards,
Lindley Lee
