Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inoatients

 

with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study
- Tne Lancet

The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1
uig/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.

Prolonged virai shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected
patients and optima! antiviral interventions in the future.

Cytokine storm during viral infection ts
a prospective predictor of morbidity
and mortality, yet the cellular sources
remain undefined. Here, using genetic
and chemical tools to probe functions
of the S1P 1 receptor, we elucidate
cellular and signaling mechanisms
important in initiating cytokine storm.
Whiie $1P 1 receptor is expressed on
endothelial cells and lymphocytes
