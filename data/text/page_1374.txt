Great feedback, Peter. More from Vanessa Kerry:

“Initial reaction is that this is fantastic and | would be happy to help in any capacity to support it.
Please let me know how. Devil is in the details and the training of course. Truly a smart idea though”

Thanks Craig. This looks very comprehensive and something a trained RPCV (returned Peace Corps
Volunteer) could help implement.

Glenn — good luck on the Hill today. Will be eager to hear about the reception.
Some feedback from others:

e John Monahan (Georgetown) — “Very creative, kudos!”
