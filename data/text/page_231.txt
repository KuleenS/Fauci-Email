Hi Dr. Fauci -- have a couple of requests for you, one of which is to speak at our
upcoming Time 100 Summit in April - about COVID-19. I'll be sending a formal invite but
wanted to explore your interest and availability.

Also wanted to speak to you about a story I'm working on concerning the risk of community
spread of COVID-19 in the US. Wanted to get your perspective on the CDC warning and
where those cases might come from. Happy to chat whenever you're free; I'm relatively free
today and this evening. Best, Alice
