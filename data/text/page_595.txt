Subject: FW: Todays report from Dr Iwata From Kobe univ on Diamond Princess SHIP
COVID-19

Folks:

You should take a look at this video (see link). The person, who is a Japanese infectious
diseases specialist, is a bit inarticulate in the beginning of the video, but he provides a vivid and
disturbing description of the conditions on the Diamond Princess.

Dr, Fauci,

| am living in Japan (6) @ and this morning | saw this video released by

Dr. Kentaro Iwata a infectious disease control.specialist

Please have somebody on your staff review this ASAP short description of Dr lwata's 1 day visit on the
ship. He has experience with Ebola, Sars etc. He describes an alarming condition that you and CDC
must be aware of. Japan hasno CDC and they tend to be very bureaucratic.
