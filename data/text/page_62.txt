Subject: Questions from Sen. Alexander

Hi Laura and team,

Thanks for all your work in advance of tomorrow’s HELP hearing. Below are
specific questions that Sen. Alexander plans to ask Dr. Fauci and would
greatly appreciate concise answers to — he is happy to allow Dr. Fauci to
elaborate if there is additional time. Additionally, he plans to ask Dr. Schuchat
a few questions about CDC covering patient costs from quarantine.

Thank you very much and look forward to seeing you all or your colleagues
tomorrow.

Best,
HELP team
