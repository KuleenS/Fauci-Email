We are just two individuals wanting to help. I’ve been advised by an attorney that sharing this free
pattern might open us up to scrutiny from regulatory agencies or possible law suits. We don’t want to
step on any toes, nor do we want any legal entanglements.

Could the NIH make this pattern available? Or the CDC? There are millions of sewers who would be
delighted to step up and help right now. It would be great for morale, and even though it’s one step up
from nothing, IT |S SOMETHING. This could even be scaled beyond individuals making fabric face masks
for themselves. Masks could be sewn for others.

Could we please work with you?

Thank you for your consideration,
