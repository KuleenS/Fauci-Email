Dear Dr. Fauci,

Jon Banner here. You may remember me from my days at ABC News, where | was Executive Producer of
World News Tonight with Peter Jennings, Charlie Gibson, and Diane Sawyer. | was also Executive
Producer of This Week with George Stephanopoulos and early on | was George Strait’s producer. Back
then, you were the most engaging, eloquent guests on the subject of HIV/AIDS and other life and death
issues of our time, and your input was of enormous value to our viewers and the general public.

Today, | am President of the PepsiCo Foundation and EVP of Global Communications for the company. |
was hoping you could help us identify an expert to provide similar insight and analysis for our company
as we deal with the impact of the Wuhan coronavirus. While we would of course welcome your counsel,
| recognize that you have a full plate of critical responsibilities with NIH and don’t want to take up too
much of your time.

If you have a few minutes for a quick call, I’d love to get your take and catch up. If not, | would deeply
appreciate it if you could connect me with another expert over email.

Thanks very much, and hope you are doing well!
Warm regards,

Jon
