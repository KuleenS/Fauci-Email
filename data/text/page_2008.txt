corticosteroids (or whatever the best available treatment is at
that time). Having Alvesco in our emergency kits is a much
better option that someone avoidably dying because of an
overburdened healthcare facility. The other drug I have, and
have told my family and some friends to get, is called
hyroxychloriquine -- also seem to be effective and safe. But, I
think Alvesco is better because it appears to prevent the virus
from replicated so infection is wiped out and no longer
contagious. Alvesco seems to be two silver bullets in one.

I don't believe in coincidences and I'm not a conspiracy theorist,
but there are many things out of Iran that also concern me
greatly. That's all I say right now.

If all of this is old news to you, then I would greatly appreciate a
response. It can be as short as "yes". Anyway, I had to share this
information with you. Now my conscience is clear. My concern is
that it's possible you don't have some of the above info, so I
decided to send you this message.

I wrote this quickly, so I apologize in advance for any typos,
etc.

I truly appreciated your efforts, and I'm now confident that
President Trump, you, and everyone else involved is doing
everything possible to ensure the best possible outcomes. I was
deeply concerned a few weeks ago, when the gravity of the
situation seemed to not be fully recognized by several in DC.

Feel free to call me anytime. My cell # is below. If you do call, I
will keep anything we discuss confidential (if necessary).
