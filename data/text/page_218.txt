spend resources. Even if the biomedical research community had developed a
vaccine against coronaviruses, pharmaceutical companies would probably not
have considered it a profitable endeavor. Therefore, it is essential for public funds
to be used by NIH and the CDC to both discover an effective vaccine and to
manufacture it.

We need to ensure that long-term projects to develop antivirals and vaccines
against coronaviruses and other infectious agents, including tuberculosis and
influenza virus, are implemented and fully funded. We need to have a funding
system that does not depend on the often unfounded criticism or whims of grant
reviewers. Although the current peer review system is touted generally as the
best way to allocate funding, it has never been tested scientifically against an
alternative. While half of the NIH budget (currently $39 billion) may still be
allocated for high-cost projects, including clinical trials, the other half should be
awarded for periods of 10 years or longer to established scientists who have a
track-record of scientific work, as well as to young scientists who are starting their
first independent position. The budgets of these grants would be somewhat
limited, but would provide uninterrupted funding and alleviate the stress of
competing for renewals every 3-5 years. Scientists opting for these grants will not
have to submit extensive grant applications. More importantly, this system will
more than double the number of independent investigators. After a 10-12 year
period, the scientific productivity (per grant dollar) of scientists on the classical
grant system would be compared with that of scientists on long-term funding.
After all, the way we choose the mode of science funding should conform to the
way science progresses, by experimentation and analysis.
