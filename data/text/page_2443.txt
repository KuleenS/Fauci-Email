Dear Bob,

Long time, no see. Our SARS study (JID 2006, 193:1244-1249; see the
attachment) showed selective expansions of Vy9V62 T cells in survivors of
SARS-CoV infection. Interestingly, stimulated Vy9V62 T cells also display
an interferon-y-dependent anti-SARS-CoV activity and are able to directly kill
SARS-CoV-infected cells. Since it is very easy to activate human Vy9V62 T
cells in vivo (e.g., using FDA-approved and relatively non-toxic drugs for
treating bone-demineralization) and given the similarities between SARS-
CoV and SARS-CoV-2, | thought that it could be potentially useful to bring
these facts to your and Tony's attention, in spite of knowing that both of you
are probably slightly busier these days than you would like to be.

All the best and good luck with everything,
Yours as ever,
Mirek
