Subject: Opp to speak to U.S. CEO Community

Dr. Fauci,

Our national radio and magazine audience is the U.S. CEO community, and this is an invitation to be
interviewed for The CEO Show and The CEO Forum Magazine. The opportunity is to deliver your words

directly, verbatim, with no reporter's interpretation. [Company Overview attached.]

The line of questioning would be about advice for corporate leaders during a health crisis, such as we
are experiencing now with COVID-19 and such that we may experience again in the future.

We could do the 19-minute interview by phone or in person in New York City.
Certainly we honor your service and excellence as a spokesperson.
Our outlets would be effective for your messages specific to business leaders.

Please consider this invitation.
