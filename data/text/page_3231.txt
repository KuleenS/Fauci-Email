viruses with the presumed rates of mutation in other coronaviruses. So it likely took decades for
RaTG13-like viruses to mutate into 2019-nCoV.

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), another human disease caused by a coronavirus, similarly has
a link to bat viruses. But studies have built a compelling case it jumped to humans from camels. And the
phylogenetic tree from Shi’s bioRxiv paper (below) makes the camel-MERS link easy to see.

The longer a virus circulates in a human populations, the more time it has to develop mutations that
differentiate strains in infected people, and given that the 2019-nCoV sequences analyzed to date differ
from each other by seven nucleotides at most, this suggests it jumped into humans very recently. But it
remains a mystery which animal spread the virus to humans. “There’s a very large gray area between
viruses detected in bats and the virus now isolated in humans,” says Vincent Munster, a virologist at the
U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who studies coronaviruses in bats, camels, and

others species.
