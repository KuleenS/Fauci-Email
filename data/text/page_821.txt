Dear Dr. Fauci,

my name is George Skafidas and |'m a journalist working for the Greek national weekly ETHNOS

We would be very much interested in doing an interview with you, to be published in the
Sunday edition of the paper, regarding the developments surrounding the COVID-19
pandemic.

Best regards

EONO:
