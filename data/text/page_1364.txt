My take: We share the goal of rapidly and substantially ramping up the public health workforce and
should emphasize that message. It would be very challenging for any of these potential approaches to
reach 100,000 in the short term. | don’t have any special allegiance to FEMA, but their traditional role in
emergency response is quickly hiring many thousands of workers. They are hiring now, but not at this
speed and scale. CDC and FEMA shoulc have an MOU through which FEMA can hire staff and detail to
CDC , but they don’t seem to be pursuing. One model could be FEMA detailing staff to state and local
authorities to manage the hiring process. FEMA is proud of their ability to get people from “door to
desk” in one week. This would not be “federalizing” contact tracing or other public health activities. In
all cases, the invitations and the oversight would come from the state and local authorities, who are
best able to decide what mechanism(s} work for them. Lastly, this concept includes more than contact
tracing. Congresswoman Susan Brooks (R-IN) in her podcast Wednesday noted that the state 211 call
line has gone from 2,000 to 25,000-35,000 calls per day. So this concept would still have a role even if
not direct public health functions.

Subject: COVID-19 Response Corps - CDC calling for public health army

 

 

 

  

 

Thanks Craig. This NEJM article is main‘'y about heath care workers, but does mention other roles in
social support.

Important development: CDC’s Bob Redfield is calling for a public health army for contact tracing after
this acute phase:
https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/10/831200054/cdc-director-very-agegressive-
contact-tracing-needed-for-u-s-to-return-to-normal

it turns out that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been working on a plan to allow the
U.S. to safely begin to scale back those policies. CDC Director Robert Redfield spoke with NPR on
Thursday, saying that the plan relies on not only ramped-up testing but "very aggressive" contact tracing
of those who do test positive for the coronavirus, and a major scale-up of personnel to do the necessary
work.
