Dear Dr. Fauci,

I am medical director of a charity clinic in Naples, Florida. Although we try to screen pts for
cough, fever, sore throat, URI sxs, dyspnea or unusual fatigue, apparently some patients are
asymptomatic and neg for these 5 hallmarks but still contagious. There is conflict between what
our Florida governor states and what CDC states. Do you believe all of our staff should be in
goggles, mask, gown and gloves for AAL PATIENTS that we treat regardless of not meeting one
of the 5 screening criteria above. If indeed there is community spread happening, I and many
others are sitting ducks. It is not if but when!!

Thanks for any guidance you might be able to provide. I am copying to my administrative staff
as well.

Good luck. This is quite the challenge.
