Hi Hillary

Late night for me on 2019-nCoV...

Shall we say before DrFauci? Then I'll know better how to get to
him. @

Thanks a lot. Jason

Hi Jason,

Great speaking with you last week. | wanted to follow
up to let you know that Yasmine Belkaid and lan
Myles—whose work we discussed on host-microbe
interactions and developing a bacteria-based
treatment for eczema, respectively—are willing to
meet with you on Feb. 28.

Here are links to some background info:

e Dr. Belkaid’s lab page, and recent NIAID press
release about a skin microbiome study from
her lab

e Dr. Myles’ lab page, and NIAID press release

about findings from a Ph 1/2 trial assessing the
R. mucosa treatment for eczema

Dr. Belkaid is available at 1:30pm (her building is next
to the Clinical Center, where you'll be meeting with
Julie Segre | believe from 12-1ish). Dr. Myles’
schedule is a bit more flexible, and he’s currently
available to meet either in the morning before you
speak with Dr. Fauci or later in the afternoon after Dr.
Belkaid (Dr. Myles is in the Clinical Center, about a 5
min walk from Dr. Fauci’s building) — let me know if
you have a timing preference. We can firm up times a
bit closer to the date, but wanted to give you an
update.
