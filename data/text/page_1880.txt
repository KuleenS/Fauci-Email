I tried years ago, when Tony was approaching a normal retirement age,
to see if he might want after a normal lifetime of federal service, to take
some of his considerable skills and knowledge to the private sector. He
quickly said no — money did not motivate him, serving the country
did. And he stayed at NIH — to the country’s good fortune.

If there is any one medical professional who can help the country deal
with the COVID-19 crisis, it is Tony Fauci, an example of the best this
country has to offer.

He is not a miracle worker. No one is.

But Tony Fauci has the decades of experience needed to understand
infectious disease problems and prescribe a treatment that should, in
time, provide the requisite comfort, even if, in the short term, the
medicine is painful and inconvenient.
