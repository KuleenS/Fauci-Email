This story 1s about Ais mentor, Dr. Wolff, and how Dr. Wolff helped turn Dr. Fauci into the
person he is today. I would love to hear more about their relationship from your perspective. I
know this is an insanely busy time, but would you have a few minutes to chat by phone?

Thanks very much for your help. I hope you're safe and well in Durham.

All best,
Ben
