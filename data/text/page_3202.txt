New FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn faced a jam-packed agenda: opioids, CBD, vaping, and how to let
states safely import drugs. Then the Wuhan coronavirus broke out.

The virus was declared a public health emergency by HHS just a few hours after Hahn's exclusive
interview with POLITICO Friday. That kicks the agency into overdrive in multiple roles — helping speed
vaccine, drug and diagnostic test development while also trying to avoid shortages of drugs and devices
the United States needs that are made in China.

Hahn said there have not been any reports yet of disruption of the supply chain or shortages, but the
agency is looking ahead and planning for “what could potentially be the most serious of scenarios.” As of
now FDA inspections in China are being conducted on a case-by-case basis.
