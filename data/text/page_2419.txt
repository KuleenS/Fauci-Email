My name is Jeffrey "Scott" Smith. | live in [__®@Ks. For the past 35 years | have
been a Purchasing Agent in the private sector. Much of my career has dealt with China
sourcing and supplier development. | have established a wide network of suppliers and
contacts throughout China. You can see from my US Passport number ©) ©} that
| have traveled to China for the past 20 years... including spending nearly{__© ©) my
time in 2018 & 2019 visiting China suppliers. (Thankfully | returned on 15-Nov-2019,
prior to the outbreak... [7 __—_).)

| was invited by one of my trusted suppliers to offer One Step COVID-19 test kits to the
United States. The Guangzhou based supplier has [__© (J test kits available now for

very cost effective test - and provides results in 15 minutes. | will trust you to determine
the efficacy of the diagnostics.

the American healthcare public -- except for the satisfaction of doing my patriotic duty to
assist my fellow Americans. | fully understand the gravity and seriousness of this
disease. All of my factories in China have, and are, suffering from the effect and fall
out. My business in ») (6) is dealing with the effects of the supply chain disruptions.

 

| hope that this offer, and availability of a additional test kit pipeline, will help ease the
test kit shortage that we are experiencing in the USA. If you and your Procurement
