Subject: Coronavirus immunity

Hi Dr Fauci,

Has anyone considered the possibility that previous coronavirus infection(s) associated with common colds may
result in at least partial immunity to the COVID-19 virus? This may explain why the disease is generally mild in
80% of adults and apparently rare in children (most of whom get more frequent colds than adults). I would be
pleased to hear your thoughts.

Sincerely,

Lome Brandes, MD, FRCPC
