attack rates. The modelers also
looked at timing of
implementation (see figure 3). At
the time there was a great deal of
skepticism—was hard for people
to believe this was possible. Or
even 1f TLC could be effective,
was implementation practical
given the challenges trying to

implement and the 2"4 and 3"4
order consequences (especially of
closing schools). But the
modeling data combined with the
historical data was the tipping
point. Marty Cetron from CDC
and Howard Markel from U of
Michigan, published a more
extensive historical review of the
1918 pandemic showing much the
same. Since then, a group within
CDC continued to work on this
(collecting additional data from
the 2009 pandemic and
elsewhere). They published an
update of CMG in MMWR in
2017.

paper (from 2017) that Richard

little dense, but

I found this paper useful because it
provides a vocabulary for
