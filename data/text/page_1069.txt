Subject: Consideration of IM COVID Immune Globulin for Prevention of COVID-19 Infection
Dear Tony,

| will always remember our amazing collaboration during the HIV/AIDS days in
the 1980s, when | served as AIDS Advisor to Bob Windom, the DHHS
Assistant Secretary for Health during President Reagan's administration. And
now, | am delighted and amazed to watch you so adroitly maneuver the
COVID-19 scientific policies and keep them front and center in the current
White House!!

C88, Michael Oxman, has worked

with John Zaia at City of Hope, and a Mayo/Hopkins/Michigan State
consortium for a trial of IM COVID-IG as a preferred method for treatment
and prevention of COVID-19.

This week, Mike expects to complete the protocol for a placebo (normal
\G)-controlled trial of IM COVID-IG prophylaxis in at-risk healthcare workers
