Fourteen evacuees from the
Diamond Princess cruise

ship quarantined in Japan were
allowed to fly back to the United
States Sunday despite testing
positive for coronavirus, the U.S.
State Department and Health and
Human Services said in a joint
statement. The evacuees were not
symptomatic.

"These individuals were moved in
the most expeditious and safe
manner to a specialized
containment area on the
evacuation aircraft to isolate them
in accordance with standard
protocols," the

statement, published Sunday,
read.
