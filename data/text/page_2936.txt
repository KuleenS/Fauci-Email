What's up in China

What's up around the world

What's up in US

And then more specific questions

Is this more like HINI than MERS

Can we really know mortality risk (denominator problem).
Incubation period

How "infectious"

News on treatment

Quarantine working

Sound OK?

You surviving - worried a bit about your workload.
