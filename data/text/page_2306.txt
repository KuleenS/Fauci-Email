Dear Prof. Anthony Fauci

My name is Chao Wu and I am a research staff in national clinical research center for infectious diseases, the first
affiliated hospital of college of medicine of Zhejiang University of China.

Based on the public data of COVID-2019 infected people in China, I have developed a simple model to warn the
potential outbreak of COVID-2019 in a region based on the age information of reported COVID-2019 infected
people.

Hope this could provide useful information for preventing COVID-2019 spreading in US. And hope the two
countries can be together to fight with COVID-2019

Best wishes!
