Sean:

As per our recent conversation, here is a paper that is under review at the NEJM. Itis from
Dr. Vincent Munster who works in my institute. It confirms what we surmised that after almost
two weeks, the chances of viable virus being present in the facility is extremely low based on
his studies reported in this paper. Figure 1B in the paper is of particular relevance regarding
our discussion of surfaces.

Best regards,
Tony

How the experiments were done:

Aerosol — A solution of live virus was made and aerosolized in a rotating drum (keeping it in aerosol
form); at various time points, air was removed and amount of virus measured (using end-point titration
on Vero cells).

Surface — A base solutions of live virus was made and placed on specific surfaces (plastic, etc) and at
various time points, coating was taken away and virus contained was titrated.

 

Note that surface experiments with proteinaceous material (e.g., respiratory secretions) are underway,
as are variations in relative humidity and temperature.

How do you interpret aerosol data?

Decay in aerosols occurs over three hours, so if the virus is aerosolized (via aerosol-generating
procedures or cough), the moment it drops below a certain threshold, it would be hard to get an
infectious dose/infection. Of course we do not actually know the infectious dose, which limits our ability
to give firm guidance based on this data.
