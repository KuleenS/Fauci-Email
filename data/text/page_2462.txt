WASHINGTON (JTA) — The American Israel Public Affairs
Committee said that at least two people who attended the
lobby’s policy conference have tested positive for the
coronavirus.

The conference, which ran from Feb. 28-March 2, drew
18,000 activists to Washington.

The AIPAC statement posted late Friday on Twitter said the
two people who tested positive are from New York. The
outbreak has been especially hard on the Orthodox Jewish
community in Westchester County, and AIPAC listed the
county’s health department as among the authorities with
which it is in communication.

The others are the New York Health Department, national
health authorities and the District of Columbia Health
Department. The statement also said the lobby was
consulting with Edward Septimus, a professor of internal
medicine at Texas A&M University.

The statement posted on Twitter said an email was going out
to all attendees as well as to congressional offices. The
conference routinely attracts a majority of Congress members
and their staffers.
