Hello Dr Fauci

’'m the programme editor of The Nine, a nightly news and current affairs programme on the BBC. I was
hoping you could spare ten minutes at some point today (March 26) to speak to us over Skype or

FaceTime about the US response the Coronavirus pandemic.

lf that’s possible, I’ll ask one of my producers to arrange it at a time convenient for you.
