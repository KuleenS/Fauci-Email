Hi Tony,

| hope that you are doing well despite all that you are dealing with around COVID-19. It has been many
years since | had the opportunity to work with you but my job at NIAID was one of my favorite positions
and gave me a great start to my career. So, when | saw the below graphic, it made me smile and |
wanted to send you a note.

| truly appreciate how you are handling the COVID-19 situation. Your comments are a breath of fresh air
amidst politics and uncertainty. With daily White House press briefings, increased security and scrutiny,
24/7 media interviews and great popularity, you seem to be holding up well - as you always do. Your
recent interview with JAMA’s Editor-in-Chief Howard Bauchner was particularly well done and very
enlightening.
