Long before he was an electee to the Basketball Hall of Fame, Mike Breen was an intimidated

18-year-old freshman attending a workshop at Fordham’s renowned college radio station,
WFUV, in the fall of 1979.

Breen felt sheepish next to the juniors and seniors leading the seminar and contemplated
delaying the start of his broadcasting training. Soon, a couple of upperclassmen, including future
NBA writer Dave D’Alesandro, made him feel more comfortable.

But he still didn’t have any friends until one day on campus he saw a confident sophomore trying
to sweet talk a young woman. “I know you like me,” he said. “I can see it in your eyes.”

The woman responded by saying she would not date him if he were the last man on earth. She
essentially was saying, “See ya” ... to Michael Kay.

That is how Breen first became friends with Kay.

‘For him to have the confidence to do this in front of everybody with this beautiful student, I
thought, ‘Man, this guy has a great sense of humor,’” Breen said.

Four decades later, Breen and Kay are still good friends.
