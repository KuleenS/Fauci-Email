be run in a BSL-3 facility. Other similar contacts I’ve had with pharma and
biotech tell me that there is a high degree of interest and willingness to
combine forces at this time of crisis.

This isn’t exactly a precise recipe for AMP-COVID, but it has some of the same
flavor. Would it be useful for FNIH to convene a virtual meeting with a few
heads of R&D (hopefully you; Mikael Dolsten has already expressed
enthusiasm; and I’d be interested in your suggestions of others), FDA (Marks
and Woodcock), leaders from NIAID and a few other NIH Institutes with
equity in this space. We might be able to make a short list of catalytic actions
that neither sector can do optimally right now, but together we can do
rapidly.

The focus would be on therapeutics and vaccines. But | can imagine a
separate session on diagnostics.

Does this sound worthwhile to you?
Thanks, | always value your advice and partnership.
