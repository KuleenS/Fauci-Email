NPIs are going to be central to our
response to this outbreak
(assuming our estimates of
severity prove accurate). This
email group has grown since we
began (not quite epidemic-level
growth, but getting there).
Looking ahead, I anticipate we
might encounter pushback over
the implementation of NPIs and
would expect similar
concems/arguments as were raised
back in 2006 when this strategy
first emerged. It was one of the
reasons | shared the updated data
on US households from American
Community Survey, data on
USDA programs for nutritional
support (including school meal
programs), data on schools and
enrollment, and even data on
juvenile crime. The data that was
gathered back in 2006 on social
density in various environments
