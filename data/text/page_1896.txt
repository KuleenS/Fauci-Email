Dan:

Thanks for the note. The work on an EV-D68 vaccine will continue. The
Coronavirus vaccine research is the highest priority. Both come out of Barney
Graham’s group in our VRC. Best to call Barney about the degree of possible
interference. Books are not on my mind right now.

Thanks,
Tony

Hi Dr. Fauci: | interviewed you by telephone a few months ago for an article in the New York Times
Magazine about enterovirus D68, the putative causal agent of acute flaccid myelitis. At the time you
