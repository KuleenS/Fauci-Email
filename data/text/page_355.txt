Thanks very much for the quick response.

Do you know at this stage when the phase 1 trial will be completed and how many people
will participate in it?

Many thanks,
Hanna

The phase 1 trial to determine safety for the mRNA vaccine platform
that NIH is doing with Moderna is scheduled to start within 2 months
(some time in April). However, this is just the first step in attempting to
have a vaccine available for use. Even proceeding at an emergency
speed, a vaccine would not be available for use for at least 1 to 1.5
years. It is characterized as a “vaccine”.
