dr Faucy,

Hello, my channel 1s doing a section of its news tonight (at 3:45pm your time) on the coronavirus situation in New

York. I wondered if we could interview you over skype. Do you think that might be possible at 3:45pm today your
ime?

We have a Simultaneous translator as we operate in french from our studio in Paris.

Looking forward to hear from you,

Raphaél de Montferrand
