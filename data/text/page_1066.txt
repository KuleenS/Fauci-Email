Li’s team used a more sophisticated method known as ultra-deep sequencing. Each building block of the
virus genome was read more than 100 times, allowing the researchers to see changes that could have
been overlooked by the conventional approach.

The researchers also found three consecutive changes — known as tri-nucleotide mutations — in a 60-
year-old patient, which was a rare event. Usually the genes mutated at one site at a time. This patient
spent more than 50 days in hospital, much longer than other Covid-19 patients, and even his faeces
were infectious with living viral strains.

“Investigating the functional impact of this tri-nucleotide mutation would be highly interesting,” Li and
colleagues said in the paper.

Professor Zhang Xuegong, head of the bioinformatics division at the National Laboratory for Information
Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, said ultra-deep sequencing could be an effective
strategy to track the virus’ mutation.

“It can produce some useful information,” he said.

But this approach could be much more time consuming and costly. It was unlikely to be applied to all
samples.

“Our understanding of the virus remains quite shallow,” Zhang said. Questions such as where the virus
came from, why it could kill some healthy young people while generating no detectable symptoms in
many others still left scientists scratching their heads.

“If there is a discovery that overturns the prevailing perception, don’t be surprised.”
