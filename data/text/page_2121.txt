I ask you to address the explosion of concerns among the dental community in
regards to COVID-19. We, the dental community, already high risk personnel, are at
an even higher risk at this point and time. Many of those who do not work in the
dental community are not aware of how high risk our current situation is. For 8-12
hours a day we are creating aerosols while sitting 8-12 inches from a persons open
mouth. These aerosols contain saliva and blood droplets, along with billions of other
bacteria and materials. In dentistry, saliva 1s considered a blood borne pathogen.
Although OSHA requires Level 3 masks for all aerosol producing procedures, not
all offices are complying. This DOES NOT matter anyway as we know SURGICAL
MASKS DO NOT FILTER OUT THE COVID-19 virus. I ask that you suspend non
essential dental procedures such as dental cleanings and other procedures that are
non-emergent. That we triage patients and accept EMERGENCIES ONLY. We are
at such a HIGH risk, not only to ourselves and our families, but a HIGH RISK to
spreading this virus COMMUNITY wide. Many of us are taking extra precautions
but screening patients, but with a up-to-14 day incubation period, that obviously
does not matter.

Please hear our plea to address our concerns. The American Dental Association and
the American Dental Hygicnists Association has failed us.

Thank you
