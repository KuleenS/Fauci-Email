Subject: Coronavirus

Good morning, Tony,

| woke up thinking this: given the relative sparing of young people during the
COVID-19 outbreak, could something similar to what happens with dengue be
going on? Could a second coronavirus infection - albeit with a genetically different
variant than the first - bring about worse disease than the first? And, since up toa
third of the common cold is caused by a variant of coronavirus, could older people
somehow have been primed by an earlier coronavirus infection?
