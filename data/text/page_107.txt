Subject: Fc modifications for protective anti-COVID-19 antibodies

 

Dear Tony,

| wanted to share a very recent and surprising result we’ve obtained on the
mechanism of antibody protection for anti-viral antibodies. We’ve previously shown
that bNAbs to flu and HIV require FcR engagement for their in vivo potency.
Enhancing activating FcR engagement increases the potency of these antibodies by
an order of magnitude, on average, and thus are significant contributors to anti-viral
protection.
