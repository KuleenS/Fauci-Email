Subject: Prevalence of smoking, and reported mortality rates in COVID-19

To whom it may concern:

I assert that the frequency of clinically significant disease, as well as severe disease
and mortality of COVID-19 is much higher in smokers, as is the case with any
pulmonary infection, such as influenza, or bacterial pneumonia.

This is clearly in addition to that due to the
prevalence of elderly and immunocompromised patients; but smoking status overall
may be a more significant nsk factor for clinically significant disease.

In listening to the news media, smoking has not been addressed as a significant risk
factor for disease.

I] would suspect that smoking is at least one reason that such a high mortality has
recently been seen in Italy, and China, and I expect that mortality rates, as well as
rates of clinically significant cases, will also be increased in other populations with
increased prevalences of smokers, and strongly associated with the prevalence of
smoking in the given population.

Of course, the reporting of severe disease will be modulated by the effectiveness of
the given population in containing the virus, as well as the effective reporting of

Clinical disease within the community, whether severe or not.

In listening to the news media, smoking has not been addressed as a significant risk
factor for disease. I think that it should be addressed.

One wonders if it could be a modifiable risk factor, at least in certain patients (such
as those who have not smoked for very long).
