Subject: Covid-19 Survival on Surfaces

 

Dear Anne and Tony,

| am sorry to bother you, but | am hoping that you can direct me to anyone at NIAID or CDC who is
working on the survival of Covid-19 on surfaces. This could include shipping boxes, but also on various
products and other perishable items. The food safety people here at FDA are quite concerned about the
latter, given published reports of differential coronavirus survival on various surfaces.

If it turns out that this has not been evaluated, or is not in the process of being evaluated, we are happy
to work on this in our BSL-3 labs, which are now in receipt of the virus.
