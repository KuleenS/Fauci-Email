Subject: SARS-CoV-19

Although outside my main area of expertise | have been keeping up with CoVid-19 discussion. One item
| have noted is that the disease appears to have a lower incidence in children. The other is that the virus
appears to at least in part attach through cell membrane angiotensin Il type 1 receptors. Is the lower
incidence of the disease in children possibly due to this cohort having a higher proportion of angiotensin
ll type 2 receptors compared to the adult cohort?

Sincerely,
