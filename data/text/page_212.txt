Subject: David Rubenstein’s invitation to Dr. Fauci

Patricia,

David Rubenstein asked that we reach out to you in an effort to schedule an Economic Club of
Washington event that would feature Dr. Fauci in a conversation with David on COVID-19. It is

my understanding that David had a similar interview with Dr. Fauci in the last week or so.

Below are several dates from David’s calendar for your consideration.
Wednesday, April 22 — Breakfast
