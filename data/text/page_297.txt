The Washington Post is also reporting that the CDC has been
informed about the first coronavirus case of unknown origin
confirmed in Northern California. We'd also like to talk about
that and what that could mean about the spread of this virus in
the states.

We have the following time slots open tonight:

9:10p
9:40p

10:10p

Many thanks for your time.

Sincerely,
