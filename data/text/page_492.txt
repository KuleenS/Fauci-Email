Judy Wasserheit, copied here, would also like to invite you to a special session she
is organizing on the coronavirus epidemic at the same CUGH conference in a late-
breaker session on Sunday, April 19 (the second day of the conference) from
8:45am-10:15am at the Washington Hilton Hotel (Monroe Room). This talk would
be slightly different from the plenary session and you could expand on COVID19
research priorities and update on progress. We realize your schedule is very
busy but your insights and knowledge on both of these topics is unparalleled. If
you cannot speak at the second session we would appreciate your
recommendation as to an alternative who could address this latter topic.

Thanks and all the best,
Tom

Panel Title: “Emerging Infectious Diseases and their Impact on Global Health
Security”

Short Panel Description: This Plenary Panel will highlight the continual threats of
emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, and their impact on global security
for surveillance, detection, treatment and prevention of these diseases. Over
recent decades, multiple epidemic events have underscored how highly
vulnerable we are to viral threats. Our world is globally connected—and an
“emerging threat" in one part of the world can pose a threat everywhere and to
everyone. About 75 percent of new human diseases are caused by microbes that
originate in animals. These include HIV, influenza (including pandemic H1N1,
HS5N1, and H7N9), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Ebola, Marburg, and Nipah. The
recent emergence of COVID from China clearly illustrates the magnitude, rapidity
