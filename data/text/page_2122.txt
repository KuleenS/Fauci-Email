Subject: Lifting EUA

 

Hi Tony —

Per our conversation, see the attached email asking FDA to lift the EUA, which would allow
CLIA hospital labs to ramp up test capacity significantly. We have sent this letter also to Francis
and to Adam Boehler and were on a call with them. Jeff Shuren at FDA also knows, but we think
it will be important to take action quickly.

Many thanks, let me know if you need anything else from me at this time.

Sincerely,
Stefano
