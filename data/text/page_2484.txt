With mild symptoms, you go to an isolation center. They were set up in gymnasiums, stadiums — up to
1,000 beds. But if you were severe or critical, you’d go straight to hospitals. Anyone with other illnesses
or over age 65 would also go straight to hospitals.

What were mild, severe and critical? We think of “mild” as like a minor cold.

No. “Mild” was a positive test, fever, cough — maybe even pneumonia, but not needing oxygen.
“Severe” was breathing rate up and oxygen saturation down, so needing oxygen or a ventilator.
“Critical” was respiratory failure or multi-organ failure.

So saying 80 percent of all cases are mild doesn’t mean what we thought.

I’m Canadian. This is the Wayne Gretzky of viruses — people didn’t think it was big enough or fast
enough to have the impact it does.

Hospitals were also separated?

Yes. The best hospitals were designated just for Covid, severe and critical. All elective surgeries were
postponed. Patients were moved. Other hospitals were designated just for routine care: women still
have to give birth, people still suffer trauma and heart attacks.

They built two new hospitals, and they rebuilt hospitals. If you had a long ward, they’d build a wall at the
end with a window, so it was an isolation ward with “dirty” and “clean” zones. You’d go in, gown up,
treat patients, and then go out the other way and de-gown. It was like an Ebola treatment unit, but
without as much disinfection because it’s not body fluids.

How good were the severe and critical care?

China is really good at keeping people alive. Its hospitals looked better than some | see here in
Switzerland. We'd ask, “How many ventilators do you have?” They’d say “50.” Wow! We’d say, “How
many ECMOs?” They'd say “five.” The team member from the Robert Koch Institute said, “Five? In
Germany, you get three, maybe. And just in Berlin.”
