Please take a look at this. We get these inquiries from Indians all the time. They read HPIM
very carefully. Is there anything we need to change here?

Dear Professor Anthony Fauci and Professor Kami Kim,
Greetings from Pondicherry, India. This is Dr K Neelakantan Viswanathan, Senior Professor of Medicine
in a medical school here.

Going through your excellent chapter, [Chapter 197) in page 1445, on AIDS and related disorders in
HPIM-20, under secondary prophylaxis / maintenance therapy for Toxoplasmosis it is said that “it may
be discontinued in the setting of effective cART and increases in CD4+ T cell counts to > 200 /
microliter for 6 months”.
