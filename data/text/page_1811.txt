Dear Tony: I sent a note to Patty with updates. Task Force in progress (asked for more information) and we have
finalized plans for distribution/release of the film for when this is over next year and we all feel good about being
together in a theater. Will now push to do tiny bits of filming and audio a couple of times a week.

Thanks for everything and thanks yesterday for talking to the frontline. Close friends there have asked me to pass on
their gratitude.

See you soon and follow Chris’ advice about taking care of yourself.
Janet
