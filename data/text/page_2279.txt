This is—____ 9} Stephen Chiarello from OU.

I am a board-certified dermatologist and internist.

Just a brief note and certainly somewhat quixotic: The treatment of toxic epidermal
necrolysis With IV vitamin C and thiamine (benfotoxamine) May well stop the
cytokine cascade with the coronavirus. This was used Wayback in the polio
epidemic before the vaccine with great success but limited subscription.

[ll send you the references.

Sincerely,
