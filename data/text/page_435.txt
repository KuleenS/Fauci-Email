If possible, I'd love to send you the questions before we talk. Since we have time difference, | might not
be available during the early afternoon (your time) but | could make it in the morning, noon and maybe
late in the afternoon and evening (your time).

I’m sorry for bothering you on this subject, but we face severe difficulty in understanding this new virus
and taking measures properly. We have quite limited sources and perspectives for understanding this
new virus. However, as a science reporter, | believe ina crisis of public health, the information is the key
for the public. They should have the opportunity to hear more perspectives from different specialists.
Since you are experienced in fighting against so many viruses, especially SARS, | believe your opinions
will be inspiring to the readers.

It would be of great help and great honor for us to invite you for an interview. A phone call interview
would be preferred but if time doesn’t work for you, is it possible for you to reply via email? I'll list all
the questions in detail.

| could be reached by (0) 6} or FO) FJ I’m looking forward to your reply.
Best wishes,

Faye
