Coach K and | came to duke on the same day in 1980 and

CC J...when | was chair and he wasn’t quite so famous, he used to see all my division chief
recruits and help me recruit. He is a really good guy, as you know.

Am on the francis Collins-appointed NI4 working group for COVID19 vaccines, first meeting in the am...
Will continue to flog CoV2 simultanelously while making good progress on HIV. This past week had 4
HIV SABS, CHAVD, an IPCAVD, an HIVRAD we have with Scripps, and our GMP unit.....all on line. Not
messing around.... All went really, really well.

Thanks for all you continue to do.

Best bart

DHVI members and they were very inspired!
