1. Is work on developing a vaccine against the novel coronavirus interrupting or slowing work on EV-
D68? Hard to believe it wouldn't have an effect.

2. When things calm down with COVID-19, would you consider allowing me to write a biography
about you, or helping you write a memoir? This pandemic has kind of turned you into the face of
medical science in the United States. I'm the author of four prior science books, and have profiled
countless scientists in the Times, The Atlantic, and elsewhere. | know this is not the time for such
things. | just want to put the idea out there. | hope and pray you do not find it offensive for me
suggest such a thing at this time of danger and stress.

Let me know about that EV-D68 vaccine if you can. I'm also reaching out to Barney Graham. Thank
you, Dan Hurley
