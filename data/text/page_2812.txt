Subject: Invitation to Speak at the March 13-15 Trilateral Commission Meeting in Washington, D.C.

Dear Dr. Fauci,

The Trilateral Commission will hold its invitation-only annual plenary meeting in Washington, D.C., on
March 13-15, 2020. | would like to invite you to participate in a conversation at the meeting on
responding to the coronavirus and global pandemics.

As you may know, the Trilateral Commission was launched by David Rockefeller in 1973 to think through
the shared challenges and leadership responsibilities of the three principal industrialized democratic
areas of the world: Europe, North American, and Japan (now Asia). Today, the Commission believes its
original mission of bringing democratic countries together to tackle international challenges should once
again be a major priority for our country and our partners. This year's plenary meeting is a major, three-
day gathering of our global membership during which we will explore the theme "Democracy and
Capitalism at a Crossroads."
