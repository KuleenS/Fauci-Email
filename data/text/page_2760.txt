e The theme for our upcoming meeting is “The Next Decade - Major trends in
technology, geopolitics, politics, economy and health”. | have attached a copy of
our Draft CONFIDENTIAL and list of attendees for Dr. Fauci’s reference.

e During his discussion with David Rubenstein, are there any slides he would like to
use for reference? We do not use a lot of these but thought there might be slides
that would aid in his discussion? Just let us know.

Warmest regards,

Marlene
