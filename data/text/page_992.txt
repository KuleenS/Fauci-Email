Tony,

We send you our new simulations.

In summary, the USA COVID-19 epidemic model says :

- the final size of epidemic = more than 779000 people infected and detected;

- date of epidemic peak = +/- 7 April 2020 with theorical new cases - in one day during
this peak - about +/- 35063;

- end of epidemic = +/- 4-13 June 2020 (we use two methods);
- mortality at the end of epidemic:

** if dead rate 5% = +/- 40000 deceased people

** if dead rate 10% = +/- 80.000 deceased people

You reached 87.5 % of the theorical logistic curve.

Best regards.

Quirico
