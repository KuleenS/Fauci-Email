Dear Dr. Fauci,

It would be good to know if you still believe Americans can trust CDC's public-facing authority or
whether we'd best look to WHO for reliable information about the virus, the disease and any
new mutations which might arise. Mike Pence does not have appropriate credentials.

Sincerely,

D.A. Sonneborn, Ph.D.
