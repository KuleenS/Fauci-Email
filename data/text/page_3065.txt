Dear Dr. Fauci,

As you realized the Indian researcher published a paper few days ago entitled "Uncanny
similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag", which
was latterly withdrawn due to the controversial indication. I did a quick SWISS-MODEL online
calculation. Page 1-3 of the attachment show the flexible loops of insertion "1", "2", and "3"
originally from V4, V5 and V1 of HIV-1 gp120, respectively. But they are in presence on the
spike protein of both bat and 2019 coronavirus (page 4 and 6). These insertions are potential
CD4 binding domains (no proof yet but highly likely) and spatially won't interfere with ACE-2
binding domain (both SARS and 2019 coronavirus target ACE-2, page 5 and 6). In another word

the 2019 virus could be potentially dual-targeting, infecting the lung and potentially CD4 T cells
too (like HIV, see page 6)!

Itis VERY URGENT to have clinicians follow up the confirmed cases such as by isolating their
CD4 cells and doing RT-PCR. Please reach out to them. Research labs including mine after
obtaining Spike protein of 2019-nCoV shall examine its interaction with CD4.
