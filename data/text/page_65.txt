This is the descriptive portion of my column. | don’t want to over or under-state:

America is entering a disturbing new stage in the coronavirus
outbreak. There has been community spread in at least one and likely two
locations in Washington State. And it appears the virus was being
transmitted for at least a few weeks before current cases were recognized.
So we can expect dozens or hundreds of cases in those locations unless
contact tracing is especially efficient.

That means the disease is loose and easily transmitted.

The crucial issue now is the real mortality rate, which remains
uncertain. The stated mortality is 2 percent. American experts are hoping
the rate turns out to be considerably lower. But the math remains troubling
in any case. If only 5 percent of the population eventually gets infected
(which is on the low side of some estimates) and the mortality rate is 1
percent, there still would be a few hundred thousand deaths.
