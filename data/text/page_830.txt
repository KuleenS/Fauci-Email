Quick update

Update in confidence
European network from this morning:

16 Paris, 2 Geneva, few Madrid last 10 days - nothing like this usually seen even with seasonal
KD or TSS

Barcelona have slightly different experience of 6 ‘Kawasaki’ in last 2 weeks - couple now who
have large coronary aneurysms, as have one child South London and one in Bristol.

Most UK PICU have 1-2 of these type of cases

Phenotype seems Diarrhoea and abdominal pain, refractory shock then various degrees of
heart involvement and inflammation ++ - several have had their normal appendix whipped out
Most negative respiratory and stool PCR for anything, some positive resp PCR COVID - GOSH
early case has seroconverted, but had immunoglobulin

We are establishing database UK and Europe and trying to define what the clinician features are
and agree investigations.

Notably, none in US reported (just D/W Boston childrens who have been running shared
international COVID experience web calls) and none in Rome, unsure about rest of Italy yet
Does seem BAME preponderance -?? immune related or social phenomenon, in terms of
deprivation prevalence and ability to isolate
