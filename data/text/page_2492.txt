so there's a dramatically lower chance of passing something along. These are a great
protective measure for your staff. The CDC mentioned that sodium hypochlorite
(bleach) may be effective against Novel Coronavirus, so it stands to reason that our
scrubs will help against unwanted spreading as well.

Finally, we have our Path-O-Wrap, which protects mattresses and gurneys from the
harsh chemicals used during cleaning. It also can help dramatically when a
catastrophic event happens, as you simply put these on a gumey or mattress and
remove them between patients. It was invented by an EMT for just this purpose, and
may be exactly what you need for your Emergency Preparedness Program.

We also have other great IP products such as:

e UV Disinfection Boxes to create a "touch-less check-in" to protect staff and
patients alike
e HealthySole UV solutions for the bottom of feet for OR and other sensitive
areas
e Bowman Cover Your Cough Stations
I have attached a couple of brochures for your review. We can provide you with a
quote, or have our local representative bring in samples of some of the products to
show. Simply write me back with what you would like more information on. We feel
our products will make a difference for your facility; let us know how we can help.

Sincerely,
