S. Korea reports 52 new virus
cases, total now at 156

Welfare/Medicine 10:37 February 21, 2020

SEOUL, Feb. 21 (Yonhap) -- South Korea reported 52 new cases of the
new coronavirus Friday, bringing the total number of infections in the
nation to 156, with the potentially fatal illness spreading fast across the
country.

The number of COVID-19 infections here has almost tripled in just
three days, with most new infections traced to church services 1n the
southeastern city of Daegu.

Of the 52 new cases, 41 are in Daegu, 300 kilometers southeast of
Seoul, and the neighboring North Gyeongsang Province. Another three
were reported in Seoul, the Korea Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (KCDC) said in a statement.

Tour buses are parked at a logistics terminal in Daegu, 300 kilometers
southeast of Seoul, on Feb. 20, 2020. Thirty-eight new coronavirus
cases were reported in the city on Feb. 21, 2010. (Yonhap)

The spike of infections in Daegu and several cases in Seoul, where
routes of infections are not immediately traceable, have prompted health
officials to declare that COVID-19 has begun spreading locally.

The KCDC said two new cases were reported in South Gyeongsang
Province. In a sign that the virus may broadly spread nationwide, six
provinces, including Gyeonggi, Jeju, Chungcheong and North Jolla,
each reported one case.
