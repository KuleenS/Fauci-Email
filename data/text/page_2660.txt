etc., out of the ER and
out of the hospital.
That is what they can
do to help unburden
ERs and hospitals for
the surge in COVID
patients in ERs and
hospitals. I would
leverage telephone
care as much as
possible to handle
patients with mild
disease seeking care
related to COVID
(and quickly develop
algorithms to
determine who has
mild disease and can
be managed by
telephone at home
and who needs to
evaluated in the ER).
Think of it like the
program Lisa
developed for
pandemic influenza
(Nurse On Call) on
steroids, minus the
antiviral piece. Could
we repurpose and
leverage that program
for COVID? Such a
strategy would help to
conserve our PPE
supply (avoid the
expansion of fit
testing and the
redirection of already
limited supplies of
PPE to outlying
clinics) and not ask
outlying clinics to do
something they don’t
typically do (that
usually doesn’t out
turn out very well). If
