Hello, Dr. Fauci,

My name is Donna Prosser, and | am the Chief Clinical Officer at the Patient Safety Movement
Foundation. We are planning to host a webinar on Friday, March 6 at 8:00am PST to update our network
on the coronavirus outbreak. Our network consists of 4,710 healthcare organizations across 46
countries, as well as patients, families, individual clinicians, and technology companies across the globe,
who partner with us to achieve our goal of eliminating deaths from medical error.

During Friday's webinar, we plan to focus on how to keep patients safe from harm during this outbreak,
and would love to have someone with your expertise join the call for a brief comment. Would you by
any chance be available and willing to speak with our network sometime between 8-9am PST? We
would be grateful for any amount of time that you could spare during that hour.

Thank you for your consideration!

Donna
