Tony--

It has been awhile since we have worked together since my time as the senior SES
standing up DTRA (with the help of Josh Lederberg M.D. & Dave Franz DVM who you
know), at Argonne/UofChicago establishing your NIAID RBL with Olaf Schneewind
M.D., and as the DHS Director of Research reporting to SEC Michael Chertoff & U/S
Jay Cohen (RADM-ret). Michael & Jay brought me aboard when Jay was our Chief of
Naval Research at ONR and | was ONR's Executive Director & Chief Scientist. | know
you have your hands very full with the COVID-19 threat, so | wanted to give you a
heads up that a game changer for enhanced detection of COVID-19 has emerged.
Thanks to DARPA & DHS S&T sponsorship in years past of ANDE developing a real
time Rapid DNA microfluidics system for human identification, the ANDE group has a
breakthrough for detection of COVID-19 and to the future, other emerging threat
viruses.

As you may know the ANDE system for human identification (e.g. CT & DHS missions)
is mature and now deployed operationally/tactically by CENTCOM, DIA, the IC and
used most recently by DHS in their recent test bed in El Paso to demonstrate its
effective capabilities to determine family relationship in undocumented

minors. Additionally ANDE is in use by law enforcement and by officials responding to
mass casualty events (CA 2018 Camp Fire disaster, 2019 Conception dive boat fire,
and the very recent 2020 tragic helicopter crash) to ID the victims.

The ANDE system now provides 2 hour turnaround with no special training
requirements as a stand-alone system for all the above users. Our warfighters and
special operators are using the ANDE system now in field forward operations and it
meets MIL specs & is the only system certified for data submission to the DoD
ABIS/DIA DNA repository and FBI CODIS data base. The
