Tony - in a recent shoddy "investigative journalism" piece about our work here in Seattle
(https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/times-watchdog/why-the-seattle-sounders-
game-went-on-despite-coronavirus-emergency/) the reporter referred to me as being to the
Seattle area what Anthony Fauci would become to the country. So despite the crappy reporting
he bestowed upon me the highest of praise and reminded me again of the incredible service
you are doing for our country. Hang in there and take care of your self. We need you. Jeff

Why the Seattle Sounders
game March 7 went_on

-=-f despite coronavirus
emergency

As virus fears grew, public officials and
sports execs debated health risks — and
PR messages — but let 33,000 into a
March 7 Sounders match. At what cost?
