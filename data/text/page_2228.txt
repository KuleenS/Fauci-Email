Dr. Fauci,

I am working with Ashley Haase and others at Minnesota to think through the
feasibility and wisdom of this approach. Let me know your thoughts if you have the
time. You look busy latcly!

Dear Dr Fauci (Tony),

You may remember me from the early 90’s as I was the inventor of nevirapine,
the first NNRTi. We met several times at NIAID and FDA. I have since turned
my scientific interests to cancer research and discovered and developed Velcade
for multiple myeloma. And I have changed career paths again, turning to
immunotherapy to treat cancer. I am currently the CEO of Gamida Cell witha
focus on cellular therapies.

One of our programs 1s the expansion of allogeneic NK cells. We are
collaborating with Dr Jeff Miller at the University of Minnesota and are
administering 10-20 billion freshly expanded NK cells in combination with
rituximab to patients with NHL. The results are stunning with 8/11 patients
