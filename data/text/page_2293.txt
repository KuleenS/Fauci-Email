Dear Tony,

| am sorry to write that we are going to have to cancel the Fields Symposium for April 24th, but we will
re-schedule when we can. As you may know, Harvard has cancelled all meetings larger than 100 (and
this morning limited that to 25) through at least April 30th. We are sad to have to do this, but we need
to help mitigate the spread of the virus. Harvard even told the undergraduates today to go home this
weekend and take their classes on line for maybe even the rest of the semester.

Thank you for all you are doing to keep everyone informed about the coronavirus outbreak. We are
going to give you the Harvard “Veritas” award when you are next here.

Stay well.
Best regards,

David
