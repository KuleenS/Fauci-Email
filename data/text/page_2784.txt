Subject: WHO meeting

 

Hi Tony
Thanks for taking the time to talk and help with the HIV trispecific work last week. I appreciate your efforts.

While I was there, you mentioned a WHO Coronavirus meeting you thought | should join. 1’m happy to attend but
have not yet received an invite. Sometimes WHO excludes companies from such meetings, which is unfortunate
and to their detriment. In any case, please let me know if I can help in any way.

Best regards

Gary
