Thanks for the note. Would your companies be able to effectively advocate for
improved health care systems in low and middle income countries?
Best,

Dr. Fauci,

| hope you are well.

Last February, | moved to Business Roundtable, which represents CEOs of large U.S. companies. Josh is
the BRT CEO, and it’s been great to work with him again.

We wanted to check with you on something quickly. Traditionally, BRT has not weighed in on global
health security policy, but COVID-19 has served as a reminder that global companies need to be strong
advocates for global public health and security. If you had your choice, what would you want to see

our companies advocating for, specifically?

No worries at all if you don’t have time to respond. We fully appreciate how important your time is.
