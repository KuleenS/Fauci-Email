Dear Tony,

Thanks for your JAMA piece on 2019-nCoV. Perhaps I can help in a
small way:

In 2003, with SARS, the Ro was initially considered to be over 2, but in
fact that was the conflation of the nosocomial and community rates. In the
2004 paper, we showed that nosocomial rate was much higher, and that the
Ro in the community was between 1 and 2. A lower Ro in the community
accounts for why moderate public health actions could move it toward
extinction--and why it propagated in Beijing, but not Shanghai, in Toronto
