My thinking is evolving in terms
of healthcare system response.
Initially I described how I would
refocus the outpatient clinics away
from COVID care and leverage
the NPIs of isolation and
quarantine to help keep the
workplace safe (for the clinic staff
and other patients) rather than a
strategy that employs PPE. I
would only use the outpatient
clinic staff to help with
telephone/home care support of
those patients under home
isolation or home quarantine--to
help with compliance/adherence to
isolation and quarantine,
monitoring their health, and
optimizing the care of their other
chronic medical conditions (to
keep them out of the ER and the
hospital). But as I thought more
about this, it occurs to me that this
can be generalized beyond
outpatient clinics.

I would think about dividing our
healthcare system into two big
pieces: (1) acute care (EDs, acute
inpatient care, critical care); and
(2) non-acute care including
outpatient clinics (PC/Family
Practice, pediatrics, OB/GYN,
medical specialty, surgical
specialty, dental, mental health,
rehab, etc.), as well as other
inpatient areas (inpatient mental
health, substance abuse, nursing
homes, hospice care, memory
care, assisted living, etc.).
Inpatient surgery (and I suppose
labor and delivery) is part of acute
care, but for this outbreak, it
probably best belongs bundled
with the other non-acute inpatient
