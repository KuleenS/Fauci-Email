Subject: Re: estimation of dynamics of COVID-19 in USA new simulations at 21 April 2020

Tony,
Professor COPPIETERS and |, we send you our new simulations :
In summary, the USA COVID-19 epidemic model says :

- the final size of epidemic = more than 850610 people infected and detected;

- date of epidemic peak = +/- 7 April 2020 with theorical new cases - in one day during
this peak - about +/- 35520;

- end of epidemic = +/- 19-28 June 2020 (we use two methods);

- mortality at the end of epidemic :

** if death rate 5% = +/- 42.530 deceased people (for the moment the death rate = 5%)
** if death rate 10% = +/- 85.060 deceased people

You reached 91,1 % of the theorical logistic curve.

Best regards.
