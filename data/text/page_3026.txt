Subject: Question

Tony,

| was asked if there is any message that the A&I community should receive in regards to the current
Coronavirus outbreak in China and potential impact on the US. | recognize the CDC and state medical
boards are releasing updates and recommendations but the question posed to me was is there anything
AAAAI should communicate to our members? Thank you for considering this question.

Regards,
