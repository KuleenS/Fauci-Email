Too soon to predict. It probably will evolve into a widespread infection (pandemic) with lower mortality than we
are now seeing (2%). More similar to 2009 HINI flu than SARS even though the virus (coronavirus) is in the same
family of viruses as SARS.

Tony,

New Coronavirus: saw you on national news with a dozen others at DT’s table yesterday.

Seems like this new one though serious anc very contagious is not as lethal (40:1 ?) as SARS, others.
What is your current thinking on it?

Hope all is well, otherwise.

Thanks,

howard
