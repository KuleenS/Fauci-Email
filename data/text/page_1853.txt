Hi Tony,

Thank you for your tireless efforts to clearly communicate about the pandemic, including correcting the
President when necessary. You do it in such a non-threatening and respectful style. | think everyone
appreciates it.

| runs a home health care company in NC and many other states in the nation.
He has managed to get some of the largest home care companies as well as the Home Care Association
of America (their trade organization) to sign off on this call for guidance for their industry which
provides professional care givers, largely CNAs, to those needing assistance with daily living throughout
the nation.

lam reaching out hoping that you might know to whom this message should really go.

Thanks again for all you do — and take care of yourself! The nation needs you.

Sincerely, Linda
