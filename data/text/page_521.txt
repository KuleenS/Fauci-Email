Dear Drs Wu, Brooks, Baric, and Fauci:

It is more than incredibly impressive at how all of you, in just the past few days, have rearranged your
schedules and agreed to participate in this special session in only about 2 weeks. We are all very
grateful, and know this will be tremendously impactful for the CROI audience.

Below is the final list of presentations, although the order and titles may well change. We are hoping to
have a conference call with the session liaisons and speakers next week if possible, to go over each of
the talks to address the overall plan and discuss any overlap. Shortly we will send out a poll for
availability for early morning in China, early-mid afternoon in the US West Coast, and late afternoon-

evening in the US East Coast. If you can respond to the poll by Monday we would greatly appreciate it;
things are moving quickly.

Many thanks again,

All of us at CROI!
