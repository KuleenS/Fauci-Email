When the first 2019-nCoV sequence became available, researchers placed it on a family tree of
known coronaviruses—which are abundant and infect many species—and found that it was most
closely related to relatives found in bats. A team led by Shi Zheng-Li, a coronavirus specialist at the
Wuhan Institute of Virology, reported on 23 January on bioRxiv that 2019-nCoV’s sequence was
96.2% similar to a bat virus and had 79.5% similarity to the coronavirus that causes severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS), a disease whose initial outoreak was also in China more than 15 years
ago. But the SARS coronavirus has a similarly close relationship to bat viruses, and sequence data
make a powerful case that it jumped into people from a coronavirus in civets that differed from
human SARS viruses by as few as 10 nucleotides. That’s one reason why many scientists suspect
there’s an “intermediary” host species—or several—between bats and 2019-nCoV.

According to Bedford's analysis, the bat coronavirus sequence that Shi Zheng-Li’s team highlighted,
dubbed RaTG13, differs from 2019-nCoV by nearly 1100 nucleotides. On nextstrain.org, a site he co-
founded, Bedford has created coronavirus family trees (example below) that include bat, civet, SARS,
and 2019-nCoV sequences. (The trees are interactive—by dragging a computer mouse over them, it’s
easy to see the differences and similarities between the sequences.)

Bedford’s analyses of RalG13 and 2019-nCoV suggest that the two viruses shared a common ancestor
25 to 65 years ago, an estimate he arrived at by combining the difference in nucleotides between the
viruses with the presumed rates of mutation in other coronaviruses. So it likely took decades for
RaTG13-like viruses to mutate into 2019-nCoV.

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), another human disease caused by a coronavirus, similarly
has a link to bat viruses. But studies have built a compelling case it jumped to humans from camels.
And the phylogenetic tree from Shi’s bioRxiv paper (below) makes the camel-MERS link easy to see.
