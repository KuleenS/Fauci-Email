Hi Dr. Fauci,

epiqar (https://epigar.com/) is the only system in the world that can help experienced
surgeons continue to support teams of less experienced surgeons worldwide, which we're
doing with Coronavirus quarantined surgeons in France & Italy now while we expand to
other theaters.

For Coronavirus care we've just developed an easy plug in kit for remote hospital surgeries
which US hospitals need to be made aware of before they get overwhelmed the way they
are in Italy & China.

Here's an article on epiqar from today inThe Hill.
Please let me know how we can help your teams.

Thanks,

Jason Ressler
