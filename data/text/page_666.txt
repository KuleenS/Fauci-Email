Natalie:

Thank you for your note. Dr. Robert Kadlec, the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and
Response (ASPR) at HHS could either answer this question or point you in the direction of
someone who could. | am copying him on this e-mail.

Best regards,
Tony

Hi Dr Fauci,

| hope this note finds you well and that you’ve gotten a little rest over the weekend, during what I’m
sure is an inordinately busy time. Would you be able to elaborate on the measures taken to keep the 14
US evacuees who have coronavirus from infecting others on board the plane? | know that remdesivir,
under compassionate use, was given to at least the first American coronavirus patient, and last week
NIH researchers published results early that it had preventive effects for macaques exposed to MERS.
Has the US considered using this drug to protect those exposed to but not yet infected with
coronavirus?

Thank you,

Natalie A Rahhal
Acting US Health Editor
