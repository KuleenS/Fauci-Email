Folks, we're doing a story that focuses in part on the administration's conference call from last Thursday
noon about a decision to send out more CDC coronavirus assays despite the fact that they had become
contaminated and compromised. We understand that Dr. Fauci was one of four federal doctors (the
others being Drs. Hahn, Shuren and Shah) who strongly recommended the assays not be sent out.

| want to give Dr. Fauci a chance, on or off the record, to comment on the story please.

Thank you,

Tom Burton
