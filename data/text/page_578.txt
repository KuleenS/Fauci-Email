Dear Dr. Fauci,

On behalf of the World Bank health team, in coordination with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness
Innovations (CEPI), it is our pleasure to invite you to a half-day consultation on Financing Coronavirus
Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Vaccine Development. The meeting is set to take place on Thursday, February
20, 2020 from 9:30am to 1:30pm at the World Bank Offices in Washington DC (located at 1818 H St
NW) on floor C2, conference room MC C2-125.

As you know, the novel Coronavirus outbreak, which started in Wuhan, China, is evolving rapidly. As of
today, the number of confirmed cases has increased significantly to over 60,000 and the virus has
reached 25 countries. The outbreak, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), poses
a threat to countries worldwide, especially those with weak health systems and low levels of pandemic
preparedness.

It is of urgent importance that we move quickly to finance the development of the appropriate
countermeasures for a disease that risks becoming endemic across the globe. Two critical issues are
necessary to address: i) immediate financing for the development and scale-up of a diversified portfolio
of vaccines, and ii) financing the manufacturing and procurement of vaccine for global distribution.

To enhance our discussions we are working on a background paper which we will share along with an
agenda at the earliest. Recognizing the short notice, we will provide remote connection details for those
unable to travel for the meeting. A working lunch will also be provided.

We hope that you will be able to participate in this important meeting. Kindly confirm your participation

to Ms. Gabrielle Williams, Health, Nutrition and Population Global Practice, World Bank
(wbhealthevents@worldbank.org). Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions.
