| do not recall getting a request from you. | am completely swamped and so it may have just
gotten buried in a pile and | did not see it. lapologize. | am mostly locked into the White
House where we must give up our phones and so it makes it very difficult for me to return
calls. | talk to Francis all the time and he is very well versed in these issues. He will do a fine
job of providing you with the information you need. If you would still like to speak with me
later on, we can try to make that work. Again, | am sorry if you felt snubbed.
Best regards,
Tony

Hi Sheila:

The questions you shared with Amanda were really for Dr. Fauci; he’s our spokesperson on all
research specific questions. | know he’s really backed up and NIAID is doing the best they can with his
incredibly packed schedule. The interview with the Atlantic was really intended as a profile, but ended
up covering a lot of COVID questions. We can check in with NIAID to see what we can do.

Thanks,

Renate
