Respected Dr. Anthony

It was great to know about you and your institution, for efforts in combating any emerging infectious
disease.

lam writing this email regarding our preliminary observation about the coronavirus genome.

| wish to share with you we have found 12 mirror DNA sequence within the genome of Coronavirus. We
have named it (MR1 to MR12). We are highly interested in MR2 as this mirror DNA Sequencers is absent

in the human genome.
—

| wish to add here there are few studies which state that mirror DNA has the potentiality to form H-DNA
and later has a potentiality to induce mutations. We strongly believe a future study on mirror DNA can
answer " Why some virus mutates faster ?" "Can we stop them from mutating?
