Subject: Association between Proton Pump Inhibitors and increased risk of Covid-19 death
Dr. Fauci,

There is a wealth of medical research papers about the association between Proton Pump
Inhibitors (PPI) and increased risk of community acquired pneumonia. Long term use of PPIs
reduce the pH of the stomach from 1 to 5. This reduction in stomach acid reduces the body's
ability to fight viruses.

In addition, the lower stomach pH reduce the ability to absorb key nutrients that require
gastric acid for breakdown and absorption (calcium, vitamin C & B12, iron, magnesium,
potassium, zinc). Lack of proper nutrients lead to a compromised immune system.

Seniors and individuals with chronic illnesses are at higher risk of ploypharmacology and dying
from Covid-19 due to PPIs. The more medications an individual takes, the more likely they will
suffer from acid reflux and thus be prescribed a PPI.

Thank you for your commitment and compassion during the pandemic. God bless you.

Regards,

Teresa McPeak
