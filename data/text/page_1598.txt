Sounds good, Dr, Fauci - we greatly appreciate the effort that you/Cliff and your team have put into
this.

Look forward to receiving and discussing the guidelines (no need for a separate meeting with me first -
we Can go straight to the Secretary) and agree that they will not be subjected to additional layers of
formal clearance given the circumstances.

Adding Judy to quickly help coordinate a time to meet with the Secretary.

Thanks again,

BH
