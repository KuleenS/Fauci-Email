papers should come out back-to-back in Virology soon. I am attaching both the
pdfs for your interest.

From scientific perspective, it is very satisfying to see that both the papers
using completely different approaches arrived at the same virion capture model.
That was not anticipated when we initiated the work 5-years ago because the
reasons to develop these assays were very different. I have mentioned to
Emerman to consider highlighting the papers in the journal issue, and that you
and Jim might be willing tom write a short piece but I have not heard about this.

With best regards,
