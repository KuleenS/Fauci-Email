Tony,

We have seen each other over the decades. | am the from NCI
who decreid the lack of information about Eboal since it was limited to fruit bats as a
reservoir,

An idea about testing. Maryland still has testing limited to subjects with
symptoms who have contact with people from affected areas or who really ill witha
respiratory infection

Why not forget the contacts and test those with flu-like symptoms without the
need for contacts but instead test for flu and if that is negative move on to covid-19.

That would still be a tremendous demand so ... go to a formal two-tier test where
PCR is done with approved PCR primers and if that is positive then the confirmation is with
a FDA test for covid-19.

There are a lot of manufacturers of PCR primers, most clinical labs have PCR
machines so that screening tests ought to be supported without a lengthy FDA clearance if
it winnows the number of patients who need a formal test.

You are terrific. Keep it up with common sense as opposed to whatever the top of
the administration suggests. | bet that the primer manufacturers would be supportive.
