Subject: Thank you!!!
Tony,

Thank you for the science-based sanity you are bringing to the COVID-19 challenges. I follow
your public comments with great interest (and publish them in our newspapers here in
Pennsylvania) and find solace that you are leading the efforts to address this extraordinary health
care challenge.

I cannot imagine the challenges you are facing, from disinformation to pure exhaustion, not to
mention the scientific challenges that this virus brings. However, if anyone is capable of
wrestling these challenges to the ground, it is you.

You have my profound appreciation and admiration.

Best wishes to you, ©) © and your family.
Bob
