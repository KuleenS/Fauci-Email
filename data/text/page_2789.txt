Good morning prof. Fauci,
my name is Alessandra Lucivero and I'm the Editorial Manager of Pazienti.it, an Italian health website,

followed by over 3 million users every month.

We would like to ask you some questions related to the Coronavirus vaccine.
We will publish the interview in Italian on our blog here: https://www.pazienti.it/news-di-salute.

The questions are:

e Coronavirus vaccine: when will it be available? What are the difficulties?
e Could the Coronavirus mutate, if a vaccine cannot be found in time?
e Will the vaccine be the solution against Coronavirus?

| hope you can be kind enough to answer my questions.

Thank you very much for your time.
