John:

Yesterday when | spoke to your IT/audio visual guy | told him to pull out the single slide with
the comparative time lines for various vaccines over the years and show it on the screen. |
then asked him to have the full set of slides ready for me to show. | have now abridged that
“full” set so that | can whip through them if it looks like the discuss slows down. Iam attaching
this abridged version here. Please ask him to substitute this shorter version for the full set
from yesterday. Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Tony
