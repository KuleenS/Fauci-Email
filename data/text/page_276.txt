Attached, please find a current draft of an agenda for a TF Briefing for VPOTUS this afternoon. Note that
this is a draft and is not final. However, in order to prepare the Secretary, can ASPA, IEA, and ASL please
help with 2-3 high-level talkers each the Secretary could highlight under the External Activity/Messaging
section of the agenda? Could you please send to me and Dr. Larry Kerr by 11 AM this morning?
Apologies for the quick turnaround.

Dr. Redfield, Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Kadlec, please note your presence on the agenda and please be prepared
to speak to the topics assigned.

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for your help.
