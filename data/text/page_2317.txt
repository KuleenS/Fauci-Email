Ditto what Francis said. If Bill is seeing the VP tomorrow, he will surely bring it
up to me at our 4:00 PM daily Task Force meeting.
Thanks,
Tony

Hi Trevor,

Truly interesting opportunity. Tony is doing a media blitz (Sean Hannity on Fox right now) but
I’m sure he will check in — and | would imagine that VP Pence will turn to him to decide how to
respond to Bill’s phone call. Doctor-based testing capability in the US has gone up substantially
in the last couple of days — after admittedly a rocky start. But home testing presents a novel
detection scheme. | assume from what you say that false negatives are uncommon and false
positives are rare?
