Subject: Great advice from Chinese expert
Dear Dr. Fauci,

Dr. Wenhong Zhang, has become very famous in China’s war against COVID-19 because of his
great excellence in anti-virus. Dr. Zhang is the Director of the Infectious Discase Department of
Huashan Hospital in Shanghai. He 1s very good according to my observation all long. Another
great doctor in China is Dr. Nanshan Zhong.

According to Dr. Zhang’s video at https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_ 6537248,
COVID-19 can really be prevented with 3 key measures, i.e. to keep social distancing, wash
hands frequently and wear masks. I strongly suggest American people should wear masks like
Chinese, South Korean people, etc., because even China’s highest leader, Mr. Jinping X1, wears
masks. If it is difficult for all the US people to do this now, I suggest working staff in airports,
supermarkets and other public places should wear masks firstly in order to avoid crossing
infection.

Further, Dr. Zhang said, if a person is still infected though he/she takes the above 3 measures
carefully, the person must be infected by his/her family members. So I propose the concentrated
isolation of mild confirmed cases should be considered as I advised yesterday.

I strongly suggest American government should lear precious experience of anti-COVID-19
from and cooperate with the mainland China, Taiwan, South Korea with an open mind. If you

need any help to contact with Dr. Zhang, I will do what I can.

I am very confident that the US government will lead American people to win the anti-COVID-
19 war by you and other great experts. Science, expertise and great learning are best medicines.

God bless you! God bless America, China and the whole world!

Best regards,
