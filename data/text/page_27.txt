project on Channel One. The big game is a television program, within the

Center, a US citizen. He was foreign policy adviser to former US President Richard
Nixon.

Only high-ranking officials participate in this discussion: presidents, diplomats,
heads of ministries.

This is an honest and reasonable discussion. It would be a great honor for us if you
