Subject: COVID-19 clinical care team
Dear Dr. Fauci,

] got a call a few minutes ago from Veronique Nussenblatt, Chief of the Clinical Center ID Consult Service,
regarding me being a part of the clinical care team of COVID-19 patients if they come to the NIH.

She did not have any definitive information but said there was a chance patients could be coming from California
this week— this is the first I had heard of that, and I’m guessing you may know more about it than | do.

The work would include either day or night shifts, likely a couple a week. People on the clinical care team are not
instructed to separate themselves from others and will be pcr tested for the virus daily when working clinically.

I wanted to ask for your OK to do this clinical work— of course I will maintain my responsibilities in the office
while doing so. Please let me know and happy to discuss further if you'd like.

Sincerely,
Andrea
