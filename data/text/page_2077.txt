Treatments for Coronavirus That Have Worked in China

Paul Craig Roberts * March 13, 2020

These are scientific papers showing effective treatments for coronavirus being used in China
Hydroxychloroquine

These research papers show great antiviral promise for both Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine. The
Chinese have started using them. So should we. The antiviral effects were originally discovered in Europe
during SARS, but then forgotten about as SARS was so aggressive it killed the host too quickly and died
out. French Prof Raoult and others have helped the Chinese advising them to proceed in this way and they
had the good sense to trial it.

Unlike vaccines and costly new antivirals, Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine are generally safe, very
well tested, cheap and readily available today. They could be a real game changer. Please publish and
disseminate. Please also re-refer to the Blaylock cytokine paper to emphasize the importance of vitamin
C, D3 ete.
