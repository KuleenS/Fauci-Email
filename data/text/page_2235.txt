Dear Tony,

I had the good fortune of working with you and Harvey Gralnick when I was a
Clinical Associate at the NIH from 1977-1979.

I am writing to express my deep appreciation for speaking truth to power and being
one of the few honest voices in the government at this time of crisis.

Your confidence and approach to articulating the issue and ramifications have
provided critical information to the American population.

Although COVID-19 is a unique event, we would have been much better prepared
had you been leading the efforts in dealing with this outbreak.

The US owes you a egrcat deal of gratitude.
