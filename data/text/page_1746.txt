Dear Dr. Fauci,

After reading the article about you on the front of the New York Times this morning, | was distressed to learn that
you have recently been negatively targeted via social media by members of a certain US political faction. The
unfaimess of these personal attacks upon you is shocking, and I cannot imagine something so hurtful happening to
someone like you who possesses such a depth of knowledge and unimpeachable integrity. You are the affable,
truthful and reassuring centre of calm during this deadly coronavirus storm. Your job is difficult cnough without

people taking verbal pot-shots every time you speak.

I wish you all the best during this trying time. Stay well (and I hope you don’t completely lose your voice, too)! I
look forward to seeing and hearing more from you on CNN and other media outlets.

Best wishes,
Nancy Hill
