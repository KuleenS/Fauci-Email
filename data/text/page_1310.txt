Dear Colleagues,
Thank you all for your support as we launch the new COVID-19 lecture series. The live videocast of yesterday's talk
was in high demand and, unfortunately, many of you were unable to gain access. This was partly because of the

large number of viewers. We are working to remedy the issues in preparation for next week's lecture.

Dr. Marston's talk, "The Biomedical Research Response to COVID-19: A View from NIAID," is now archived at
https:/'videocast.nih.gov/watch—36375.
