Subject: media inquiry on COVID-19

Dear Dr. Fauci,

| am a Brussels-based journalist, member of the European Data

Journalism Network (EDJNet), a digital news-making platform that

affiliates media outlets across Europe.

I found a quote from you in this article which seems to be quite

prophetic: https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/02/covid-
vaccine/607000/

I contact you to have a discussion about the effectiveness of the epidemic
outbreak preparedness and response measures put in place by governments,

particularly in terms of vaccine development.

I would like to know if we could ave a chat on skype. Or, if you prefer, I can send
you some questions by email.

I wait for your kind feedback
Regards
Stefano Valentino
