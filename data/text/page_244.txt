Hi there,

I'm writing for Healthline about coronavirus and how the virus spread may be different in the
Southern Hemisphere (they mention that in the story below). Care to weigh in?

I'd love to know:

1. Will coronavirus be any less severe in the Southern Hemisphere due to the summer weather there
at the moment?

2. Will the virus spread in North America slow down due to geography or warmer weather at all?
What can we expect in 3 months--and in one year as far as coronavirus in the U.S.?

3. Will it differ in how it spreads/tapers off in Asia, due to proximity of the outbreak?

4. Will this eventually be gone or will it be something that is a new health threat that could return in a
year or so?

5. Any insight into the outlook of coronavirus, how it will spread or how long it will be active?

Looking for a brief email response by Monday morning at 10 a.m. Let me know if you can assist!

Warmly,
Kristen Fischer
