 

We are prepared to discuss this with you and your team at any time that is convenient for you. As you
may know, we are locked down here ir the Research Triangle until May 15. If it makes sense, we could
arrange a WebEx as an initial step.

Many thanks for the opportunity to share this with you!

All the very best,

Dani
