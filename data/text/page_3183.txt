The setting will be relatively informal. Scooter Libby will first introduce Senator
Lieberman. Then Senator Lieberman will make a short opening statement, and look to
Billy to set the stage and talk about the zoonotic nature of the disease, associated
disease management considerations, etc., in about 5 minutes. The Senator will then ask
each of the other speakers to say a few words from their perspectives. After that,
Senator Lieberman will ask some questions of the group, allowing you all to answer and
converse. All of this should take about 45 minutes. Then we will allow the audience to
ask questions.

We are planning for Senator Lieberman to moderate the discussion and take questions
from the audience, but if for some reason he cannot do so, then Billy Karesh will.

| hope you will be able to make it, Dan. Let me know if you have any questions (and if
you will be able to make it, of course) and | look forward to seeing you on February
10th.
