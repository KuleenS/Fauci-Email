In the current state of medical knowledge and research in the pharmaceutical industry, there is
no short- or medium-term solution to prevent disease or cure patients with SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-
19).

With this letter, | would like to make you aware of the preventive and curative potential of
essential oils (EOs); lives could be saved.

Scientific aromatherapy: use of aromatic compounds extracted from plants — essential oils — for
medical purposes; ‘hard’ science of nature, based among other things, on in-depth knowledge of
organic chemistry. We are not talking about perfumery or occult sciences.

According to Mr. Dominique BAUDOUX, an internationally known Belgian pharmacist and
“aromatologist”’: there is a multitude of research on the antiviral properties of essential oils.
The results are impressive and indisputable. Here are some viruses for which we have real
data:

= Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus SARS-Cov (it is a coronavirus)
The H1N1 flu virus

Avian influenza virus type HSN1 and subtypes H7N3 and H9N2

The anti-infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)

= Herpes simplex virus HSV

=" Dengue virus DEN

Newcastle disease virus NDV

Junin virus (an arena virus responsible for hemorrhagic fever)

In addition, according to a brief email exchange with Mr. Pierre FRANCHOMME, a French
researcher, one of the leading experts in the field of medicinal essential oils, he informed me
that: a recent Indian study (March 31) highlights the potential activity of 1,8 cineole
(eucalyptol) on SARS-Cov-2, as | suspected from my experience on other enveloped viruses.

Note: the molecule 1,8 cineole is found in high concentration in eucalyptus EOs.
