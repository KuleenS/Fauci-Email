Subject: Hudson Institute speaking request

Dear Dr. Chertow,

| am the Executive Director of the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, co-chaired by
former Senator Joe Lieberman and Governor Tom Ridge. Our fiscal sponsor is Hudson
Institute, one of the think tanks here in DC. Hudson Institute's chair of the board of
trustees (Sarah May Stern) has asked Hudson Institute to run a 90 minute meeting on
the novel coronavirus situation. Hudson has asked us to help them pull a brief meeting
together in short order.

Considering your experience on the ground dealing with other outbreaks, Hudson
Institute invites you to speak at this event. In addition to one of Hudson Institute's China
experts, we are also seeing whether Senator Lieberman and Governor Ridge are
available to speak.

Here are the dates they are a looking at: February 6, February 10, and February 13.
Could you let me know if you are available and if so, when on those dates?

Thank you for your consideration, Dan. | look forward to hearing from you soon.

Asha
