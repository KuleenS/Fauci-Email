Hi!

| read that you are an expert working for NIAID and that you got interviewed about treatments for the
coronavirus.

| am a Swedish physician specialized in clinical chemistry. and wanted to
share a hypothesis | have. | believe that some patients who are seriously ill in corona virus (or flue/SARS)
with lung symptoms have a lack of normal/well functioning Alpha-1-antitrypsin for example PiZZ. Alpha-
1 antitrypsin is an acute phase reactant and increases in sick people. | have seen that the Alpha-1-
antitrypsin level can be elevated in a severely ill person (H1N1) if measured in a laboratory, even
thought the patient was homozygous for mutations in the Alpha-1-antitrypsin gene. An elevated level of
Alpha-1 antitrypsin is misleading and can result in the physician believing that there is nothing wrong
with the patients function of Alpha-1-antitrypsin.

(1)
| also guess that critically ill ECMO-treated patients with lung symptoms might benefit from receiving
Alpha-1 antiprotease inhibitor in addition to other medications given to them. What do you think?

| believe that this information can contribute in understanding why some supposedly healthy individuals

gets really sick and even die in corona virus, flue/H1N1 or SARS. FO *0) C7)

| would appreciate if you replied shortly to me so that | know that my e-mail has been read.
