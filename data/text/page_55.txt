Hello Dr Fauci,

Hope you're well. I’m a producer for Sky News, looking after our flagship evening programme Sky News
Tonight 7-10pm UK time (2-Spm ET).

| was wondering if you might be available for an interview on the coronavirus outbreak? Either today or
another day this week.

Happy to explain in more detail.
Any questions, please let me know.

Best,
Jakub
