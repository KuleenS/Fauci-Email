Dear Tony:

It's been along time. Honestly, | can’t remember when we last saw each other. | recall that
wonderful day we went to the Nats game together, although | cannot remember who else came
with us. And of course | will always remember when you came to my Partners in Health

fundraiser and introduced Paul Farmer. | will never forget your speech (and neither will Paul!).
