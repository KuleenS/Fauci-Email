IC 76) 6) as an Infectious Diseases physician in southern Indiana and Louisville.

During my career | cared for hundreds of individuals with HIV/AIDS and remember well your tireless
efforts in this regard.

Even in the midst of the current coronavirus pandemic, your knowledge and expertise continue to
prevail- a model for many. There has never been a more important time for dissemination of facts not
blind faith.

Again, congratulations !
