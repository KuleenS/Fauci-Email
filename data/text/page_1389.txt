Thank you for you note. This pandemic has been extremely challenging for many countries
around the globe including China and the USA. | can only say that | (and | am sure that Bob
Redfield feels the same way) preferto look forward and not to assign blame or fault. There are
enough problems ahead that we must face together.

Best regards,

statistics in US vs. China. Please find attached a couple of articles published by my former colleagues}

e First, the maximum lockdown in Wuhan that started on January 23 and also in the rest of the
entire Hubei province of 59 million people during the subsequent 2-3 days, coupled with
maximum efforts in early identification, immediate isolation of identified infected individuals

locked down for several weeks. Many villages and townships set up checkpoints to refuse
