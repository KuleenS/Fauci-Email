Hi Tony,

| know you must be swamped by matters related to the coronavirus. Nonetheless, I'd really like to
confer, even if briefly. Would you have any window by phone today, over the weekend or next week? I'll
also call Kim Barasch, per your recent guidance.

I'm researching an article that will chiefly explore the status of the Defense Department's advanced
development and manufacturing facility in Alachua, Florida. On a related note, I'm also curious re the
three HHS/BARDA facilities.

Best, David

David Willman
