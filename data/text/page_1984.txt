Thanks, Tony. The town meeting runs from 1 to 2. If your press conference runs late, I’d be
glad to have you call in at any other time during that hour —- we would squeeze you in!

Francis:

| was just told by the VP’s office that | will have to be at the press conference between 11:00
and 12:30 PM. And so | definitely cannot be at NIH physically at 1:00 PM and if the press
conference starts and finishes late, | may not even be able telephone in. My guess is that it will
end before 1:00 PM and so1 will likely be able to phone in. Let us see how tomorrow unfolds.
Regarding the session of IC Directors, this would be fine with me.
Best,
Tony

Patty:

Please let us discuss the phone in logistics if | cannot physically get there.
Thanks,,
Tony
