Subject: touching base about Texas Biomedical Research Institute
Hi Tony and Hugh.

| know that | am writing to you at a busy time during yet another infectious disease
outbreak that is rapidly evolving. However, | wanted to send you a brief note to update
you about the transformational change going on in the landscape of our free standing
institute with its new, sharply defined goal to be the global leader in eradicating
infectious disease threats in the world. | know that you are familiar with us.

| have been leading the institute since June of 2017 and currently finishing year one of a
10 year board-approved plan of growth in our scientists, educational programming and
Campus modernization. | believe that you are aware that we house the only private
BSL4. We also just opened our newest of 5 BSL3 facilities, this newest one being nearly
8000 sq. ft. with capacity for ~100 NHPs, small animals, a complete aerosol suite and a
PET CT. We also house the SNPRC, now under the leadership of Deepak Kaushal
(who replaced Robert Lanford) and with the largest marmoset colony as a result of _
restructuring our building facilities (in addition to our other species). | ©) ¢

 

Please check out our newly designed website: www.txbiomed.orq.

The bottom line is that I left university life to lead an organization that is determined to
not only discover critical, new fundamental science but also effectively and efficiently
bring it full forward to create portfolios for the FDA through our business model,
nimbleness, regulated science culture (GLP level), longstanding public and private
partners through contract science (esp. BARDA), culture and community support.
