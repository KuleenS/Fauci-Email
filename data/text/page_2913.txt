Francis:

Thanks for the note. Best to have Trevor have his program person who will be leading this
effort contact Cristina Cassetti in DMID. Cristina and Emily Erbelding could do all of the
necessary and appropriate coordination.

Thanks,
Tony

See reference to coronavirus research in the note from Trevor. How would you like to
coordinate this?

That would be great Francis. You might have seen our announcement this morning on the Coronavirus
reponse funding and $60M of the 100 is for R&D especially therapeutics rather than vaccines so we
might want a quick call in the next few days to think about how we coordinate this - I’ve been in touch
with Jeremy as well. Trevor
