Hi Dr. Fauci: We are updating our coronavirus story periodically, keeping it factual and level-headed, and
| have seen your comments on NPR Friday and in the NY Times over the weekend, so | hope you could
comment very briefly for our story:

-- What's your expectation for whether this will become a pandemic?

-- Pandemic does not necessarily equate to a terrible situation, compared to, say bad flu seasons. What's
your expectation on the potential severity of this coronavirus?

-- And your suggestion to people in the U.S. who might be very concerned?

Thanks for any help you can provide.
Cheers,
Rob
