Subject: [EXTERNAL] So proud

 

Dear Tony,

As a member of the Board of Directors of Weill Cornell Med

Alumni Association, I am so proud of what you are doing and proud that it all
started in Olin Hall and 1300 York Ave.

Drs McDermott, Hook, Kilbourne, Kean and Johnson must have great pride in
how you are a voice of science and reason during this crisis.

Stay strong and thank you

Richard Fj
