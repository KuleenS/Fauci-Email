Dear Tony,

1. | had planned to write to thank you for giving an interview for the
Washington Post last month. Your generosity with time was ‘all Tony,’ and | did appreciate it. |
was waiting for the chaos around you to subside before writing but.....

2. Last evening | was asked to forward the message below to you. You might already know Jack
Warren, Professor of Medicine and Infectious Diseases at U. Maryland (6,
CY As his email says, | 6] Samsung’s venture oreo group which has
an idea for a future, comprehensive surveillance system for COVID-19 fF OG]

. Itis interesting,
but all | know is what | read in the power-point attached. | cannot imagine you would have time
to look at it yourself, but perhaps it could be shared with other systems-oriented individuals
working towards ‘opening up’ responsibly.
