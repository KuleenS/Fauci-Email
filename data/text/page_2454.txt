Dear Dr. Fauci,
Today I wrote and mailed a Ietter to both you and Dr. Redfield.

I will not duplicate nor attach it here, but I did want you to make you aware of my letter in case it
doesn't reach your desk on Monday. In it I ask you and Dr. Redfield to explore the possibility of
using 2020 Census Enumerators as an “on-the-ground army" to help stop COVID-19.

Because as you know better than anyone else that time is of the essence, I thought it useful to
give you a heads-up about my letter via this email.

I am probably being naive, but just in case it makes sense to you, I thought it couldn't hurt to
write you.

Thank you for being there for us. We really need you.
Yours,

Ann E. Job (pronounced like the Book of Job in the Bible)
