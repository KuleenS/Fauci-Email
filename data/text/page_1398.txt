Hi Tony: You are doing an amazing job during these very difficult times!

Doing everything we can here to support WHO to work on global acceleration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
development as well as support our 73 poorest countries for COVID-19 preparation and hopefully
keeping routine vaccine coverage as high as possible. We are prepared to ultimately roll out a vaccine
when one is ready. No need to respond, but wanted to give you a friendly shout-out. We are all
thinking of you!

Best,

Seth
