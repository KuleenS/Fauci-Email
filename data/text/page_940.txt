Subject: SNL review

OKAY, so here is something even better than having Brad Pitt portray me on
SNL. Itis a recent review of Pitt’s performance in which the TV reviewer said :

“Kicking things off, the Oscar winner dropped jaws during the cold open with
his monologue about President Donald Trump's recent (and concerning)
comments about COVID-19.

"Good evening, I'm Dr. Anthony Fauci," Pitt began his monologue and looked
nearly identical to the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases.”

Someone said Pitt looked “nearly identical” to me. Yikes!! ©
