Subject: Cowen Health Care Conference in Boston - China Pharma Market Panel - March 2, 2020 in
Boston

Hi Dr. Fauci

lama pharmaceutical industry analyst at Cowen and Company, a New York City based
investment company that specializes in health care. Each year we host a Health Care
Conference in Boston in March that attracts 200+ companies and 1000+ investors. During this
year’s conference, we had planned to host a one-hour panel discussion on the evolution of and
reforms within the China Health Care System and China Pharmaceutical market. However,
given global concerns around Coronavirus, we have decided to focus the panel instead on the
virus and the outlook for emerging treatments. This perspective is critical to health care
companies and therefore the institutions that invest in them.

Our panel will take place during Cowen’s 40th Annual Health Care Conference, which will be
held at the Marriott Copley Place in Boston on March 2-4, 2020. We plan to host this panel on

Monday morning, March 2"4, between 9:05-10:05AM. Attendees at our conference include
institutional investors from insurance companies, mutual funds, pension funds, banks, and
other types of funds, mainly in the U.S. and EU.

Cowen would provide you an honorarium for your time during the one-hour panel. We propose
an honorarium of $1,500, and we reimburse conference-related travel expenses.

The discussion will be Q&A only and no presentation on your part is requested.
We look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,

Steve Scala
