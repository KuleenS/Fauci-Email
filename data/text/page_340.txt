Hi Tony,

I’m sure you know Michael Milken. I’ve worked with him over many years, and though he
is a somewhat controversial figure he has certainly helped NIH in many ways. He reached
out to me last night to ask if there is anything he could do to help with the coronavirus
vaccine effort. He had seen press reports that finding a pharma partner had been
challenging — and wanted to volunteer his help in that regard, since he has deep
connections in the private sector. He also said that he’d be glad to help with any
philanthropic needs, both through his own resources and his influence over members of
the Giving Pledge.

Are there useful actions that | can suggest to him?
