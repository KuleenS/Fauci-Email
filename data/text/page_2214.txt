Dear Dr. Fauci:

Thank you for your incredible dedication &expertise in dealing with the coronavirus
situation. My concern is that when the President &the virus team and others are seen
together they stand close together &shake hands. This has been ill advised by all the
medical experts, including you.

I m hoping you and the other experts will strongly advise changes in this behavior in
accordance with current recommendations. We need them to set a good example for
all.

Many thanks for your help - it s greatly appreciated.
