Tedros said on Saturday that he hoped the team would include experts from the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

“It has to be meaningful on the ground,” Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at
Georgetown Law, said in an interview in Geneva this week.

Gostin called for a “genuine partnership with transparent flows of information and
accountability for the response”, adding that there should be a strong CDC presence.

“CDC has got no peer in terms of its experience and technical expertise in dealing with
international outbreaks,” he said.

“But the other benefit is the smart diplomacy, what it could signal is that despite all of our
differences in ideology, trade, politics, that when faced with a common threat to humanity,
we come together as a human community to tackle it,” Gostin said.
