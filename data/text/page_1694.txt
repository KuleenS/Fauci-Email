CAUTION: EXTERNAL SENDER

Hi Mary,

I hope you are staying well during these unprecedented times! | wanted to give you
a heads up that we will be unveiling a bobblehead of Dr. Anthony Fauci this Friday,
April 3rd. Dr. Fauci has become America’s voice of reason as one of the lead
members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. The National Bobblehead
Hall of Fame and Museum will be donating $5 from every Dr. Fauci Bobblehead
sold to the American Hospital Association in support of the 100 Million Mask

Challenge [icm-tracking.meltwater.com]. The bobbleheads will be available for pre-

order on our website beginning on Friday.

Bobbleheads are the ultimate honor, and we think Dr. Fauci deserves it given what
he has done and continues to do for our country and the world in the battle against
COVID-19. The bobblehead will join a growing number of items including donuts,
socks and t-shirts featuring Dr. Fauci. We received a lot of requests for a bobblehead
of Dr. Fauci and are excited to be able to use the bobblehead to raise funds for a
vital organization that is helping limit the spread of the Coronavirus while making
people smile during these unprecedented times.

Let me know if you would like the press release, pictures and graphics in advance of
Friday’s release. Please hold off on publicizing anything related to the bobblehead
until Friday—any time on Friday is okay. Please also let me know if you would like
a sample when they arrive or if you have any questions.

Thank you,

NIH-000074
