Hello Dr. Fauci,

I hope you get to read this and you can do something about it. I am writing from
@) ©}, Here at South Padre Island spring break events are going in full

swing with no concern whatsoever about coronavirus spread. We do not have

positive cases yet in the Rio Grande Valley but this is inviting the disease here.

People come from all over USA, especially students in huge numbers for spring
break to SPI. In spite of repcated requests by press and gencral public the authorities
have not shut down the event. I am attaching a couple of articles below . It is very
concerning to see the authorities do not seem to understand the gravity of the
situation and the importance of social distancing which is the need of the

hour. Kindly look into this and please do what you can to put a stop to this.

Please note the crowd is expected to increase next week.
Appreciate your help.

Thanks

Regards
