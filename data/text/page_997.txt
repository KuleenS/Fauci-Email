Long ago parishioners like me remember what
the store looked like, the

soda fountain that ran along the right wall, the
telephone booths at the left close to the
entrance and the counter straight ahead down
the center.

Whenever my mother sent me there, Mr. Fauci
would be behind the

counter, but it was a family enterprise. They
lived in an apartment above the store, and if the
patriarch wasn’t serving you, his wife, Eugenia,
or daughter, Denise, was there. Young Anthony,
I’ve since learned, pitched in too, his father
sending him out on his bike to deliver items to
customers.

I’ve never met the man who has become the
most important medical voice in the country. Nor
have former parishioners that I’ve spoken to
about him in recent days, like boyhood pals
Anthony LoFrisco, from

80th St., now in Connecticut, and Bob Orlando,
who lived on 84th, now a New Jersey resident,
as well as Bishop Gerald Barbarito of the Palm
Beach Diocese, from 11th Ave. But each
remembers the pharmacy as a Dyker Heights
institution.
