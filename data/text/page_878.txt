Older adults with COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, have several “atypical” symptoms,
complicating efforts to ensure they get timely and appropriate treatment, according to physicians.
COVID-19 is typically signaled by three symptoms: a fever, an insistent cough and shortness of breath.
But older adults — the age group mostat risk of severe complications or death from this condition —
may have none of these characteristics.

Instead, seniors may seem "off" — not acting like themselves — early on after being infected by the
coronavirus. They may sleep more than usual or stop eating. They may seem unusually apathetic or
confused, losing orientation to their surroundings. They may become dizzy and fall. Sometimes, seniors
stop speaking or simply collapse.
