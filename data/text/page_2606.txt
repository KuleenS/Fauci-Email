Tedros also said there were
"relatively few cases" among
children and more research was
needed to understand why.

The WHO chief also warned
against "blanket measures" over
the novel coronavirus outbreak,
pointing out the epidemic outside
of China was only affecting a
"tiny" proportion of the
population.

Ryan said that even at the
epicentre of the crisis in the city of
Wuhan in central Hubei Province,
the "attack rate" - a measure of the
speed of spread of the virus - was
four per 100,000.

"This 1s a very serious outbreak
and it has the potential to grow,
but we need to balance that in
terms of the number of people
infected. Outside Hubei this
epidemic is affecting a very, very
tiny, tiny proportion of people,” he
said.

Tedros also referred to an apparent
decline in new cases of the disease
in recent days but said that the
trend "must be interpreted very
cautiously".
