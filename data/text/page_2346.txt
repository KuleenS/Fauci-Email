Subject: Time for an interview with America Magazine?

Dear Dr. Fauci,

America magazine is the flagship effort of America Media in New York. We are a ministry
of the Jesuits of the United States and Canada. America magazine may be the best known
Catholic publication in the United States, publish for more than 100 years.

| realize you must be supremely busy under the circumstances, but | thought | would ask if
you could spare a few minutes for an interview in New York, over the phone or on remote
via Skype for one of our internet programs to talk about the coronavirus landfall here in
the United States, how the public can best respond. We would also love to hear how your
faith is helping you cope personally, perhaps how your Jesuit background is assisting your
decision-making in this drama.

Let me know if you think anything might be possible.
Thanks,
Kevin Clarke
