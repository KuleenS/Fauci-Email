First, apologies are in order. We tried to meet about this and get you a quick response the day
after you and Tony emailed, but then coronavirus chaos ensued. We had to cancel 5 successive
meetings to go over this; in one case minutes before we were to start he got an urgent call to
go down to the White Hose asap, and that was that. Few of us in the office have even seen
Tony in recent weeks as he is down at the White Hose daily from early morning until late at
night.

Finally this morning we sat down and had a relaxed discussion. Assuming you are still
interested OQ
OR a RT da ‘

CF. Crazy times, for sure.

Thank you, | look forward to hearing from you,
