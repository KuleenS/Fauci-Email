critical piece of the puzzle to contain the virus.

practicing dentist and I have voiced my corcems to him.

> Each and everyone of us who has had an appointment with a dentist knows the procedure of pressure irrigation in
the mouth resulting in a mist and aerosol of secretions and saliva depositing on the faces of patients, the dentist and
on all the surfaces in the treatment rooms. While the dentist wears a face mask, the spray of secretions, ina
potential coronavirus carrier, widely contaminates surfaces, other employees and patients.

>

> I pose the question, should dental offices be actively treating patients during this critical phase in the Coronavirus
pandemic? Everything which | have mentioned is corroborated by several practicing dentists. Is the he CDC and
the NIH obligated to set guidelines and restrictions on dental care during this critical time as we try to get control of
increasing numbers of cases. Should the ADA take a stronger stance during this crisis?
