So a quick update.

Attached is a VP that will go up tomorrow — information for clinicians by Carlos del Rio and Preeti. They
worked on it this weekend — thanks to both.

Attached is a VP from Don and Ken Shine that came in before the epidemic/pandemic — but is definitely
related. Going up this week.

 

Attached is the largest case-series yet — from Wuhan — old colleague of Derek’s.
—————————————————————————
C&S it will be published on Friday. A big thank you to Phil and Derek.
A RL has also been accepted — it will go up Thursday.

| cannot thank Stacy and her team (and publishing) — everyone has been working overtime to process
manuscripts in record time, put up a microsite; add CME for US clinicians; etc. Mike (and his team) and

Ed have been a big help.

As we have done in the past everything will be free to the world.
