Hi Tony,

I’m forwarding an email | just sent to Paul Cieslak, MD.....one of the lead docs at
the Oregon Health Authority (CCC COC™~CCCCCSSY} e@®
gives my clinic’s Internal Medicine docs an ‘ID Update’ for my CME Grand Rounds
each year) ...with this email note from Dr. David Brandon...hope you remember
David....he was with Lynn’s & Mort Lipsett’s group at The Clinical Center.

.. ld bet a coke you know all about pooled sampling .....but wanted to pass it
along.

You have no idea how many people tell me that your COVID-19 messages on TV,

etc. are top flight, enormously helpful and encouraging for them with the best
information, in a sea now of poor information.
