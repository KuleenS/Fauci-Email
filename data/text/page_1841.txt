Hello,

I am once again in service since the global sanitary crisis COVID-19 hit France a couple of weeks ago. I
am now leading the Scientific Council for COVID-19, composed of 10 persons, serving the French

President , Emmanuel Macron.

The Council was created on March the 10th and we were heavily involved in advisory activities in relation
to the President’s decision to put the generalized quarantine into force, because we didnt have any

better choice.

Firstly

We have a limited number of diagnosis tests, this prevents us from taking up a Korean-like strategy
within the next few days. However, by the end of the quarantine (within the following six weeks), we will
be able to have a generalisation of the diagnosis test and develop korean-like apps, as well as a strategy
for testing and treatment if we have any drugs available by this time. Before this, we will go through a
difficult phase in the following weeks, because we won't have enough beds in our care units in some part

of France ...

Secondly

On the therapeutic level, Yazdan Yazdanpanah has taken my place and who is now leading REACTing.

Tomorrow morning a french-european medical trial will begin, under the control of the WHO, with 5 arms
(placebo/kalatra/kalatra +interferon béta / product of Guilead / hydroxychloroquine alone or in

combination for next week).

As you may know, we are currently facing a press buzz since the announcement made by Dr. Raoult
about the effectiveness of hydroxy-chloroquine. His data is not particularly convincing. We can distinguish
a Slight positive signal but it must be confirmed by a well made randomised trial. We also started a
monkey-model study with HC and we should have the results by the end of next week. Also a cohort of
severe COVID+ patients have been created and some will be treated with HC : we will analyse those
results with all the consciousness needed. It will also be possible to do a prevention trial for healthcare
