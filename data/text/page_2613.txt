Can’t find anything about other
countries evacuating passengers
(UK, Hong Kong, Italy, etc.)

Last thing. Am seeing storics
from Japan re patients going from
clinic to clinic with resp
symptoms and fever and being
confirmed. They are finding
nosocomial transmission—so
underscores the concerns outlined
in the proposal I outlined for re-
aligning outpatient clinics.
