Subject: CNNi Interview Request: Anthony Fauci

 

Dear Mr Fauci,
| hope this finds you well.

I’m writing to you from CNN International to see if you are available to join Becky Anderson on her
prime time flagship show ‘Connect the World’ for a live interview on today to discuss the coronavirus.

The show airs live between 10amET — 12pmET — do you have any availability during these hours to come
to a convenient bureau?

We really loved having you on the show last Sunday! As the director of the National institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases your insight is always great for our global audience.

Might it be possible to arrange something?
