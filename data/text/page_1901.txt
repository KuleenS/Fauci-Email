Favipiravir, also known as T-705, Avigan, or favilavir is an antiviral drug being developed by
Toyama Chemical (Fujifilm group) of Japan with activity against many RNA viruses. Like
certain other experimental antiviral drugs (T-1105 and T-1 106), it is a pyrazinecarboxamide
derivative. In experiments conducted in animals Favipiravir has shown activity against influenza
viruses, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus as well as other

flaviviruses, arenaviruses, bunyaviruses and alphaviruses.!!! Activity against enteroviruses!! and

Rift Valley fever virus has also been demonstrated.!?! Favipiravir has showed limited efficacy
against Zika virus in animal studies, but was less effective than other antivirals such as MK-

608.!4] The agent has also shown some efficacy against rabies,!>! and has been used
experimentally in some humans infected with the virus. 9]

In February 2020, Favipiravir was being studied in China for experimental treatment of the
emergent COVID-19 (novel coronavirus disease).!71I8] On March 17, Chinese officials suggested
the drug had been effective in treating COVID in Wuhan and Shenzhen. {1110

As of 23 March 2020, it seems that Japan and China have issued an export ban on the substance.
