In order to save Dr. Fauci, we must destroy
him

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, is a study of calm and competence in
the middle of a pandemic. Which makes him an endangered
species, working as he does for a boss who is notoriously
insecure and made his name shouting “You’re fired!” ona
reality TV show.
