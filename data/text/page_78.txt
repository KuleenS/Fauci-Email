MESSAGE ON BEHALF OF THE GPMB CO-CHAIRS DR BRUNDTLAND AND MR SY

Dear Board members,
Thank you to those of you who joined the call on Thursday on short notice.

In light of our discussion, we would like to update you on a few matters:

 

e Coronavirus outbreak. We have asked Jeremy Farrar to act as the Board's focal point on the
COVID-19 outbreak, to represent and advise the Board on the science of the outbreak and the
financing of the response. We thank Jeremy for agreeing to take on this role.

e Follow-up Board teleconference call. Since many of you were unable to attend Thursday’s call,
we wish to propose to hold a follow-up Board teleconference call on 4 March at 14:00 Geneva
time. The purpose of the call will be to discuss the coronavirus outbreak, including Jeremy’s
proposal for Board action on financing. We would appreciate if you could confirm your

participation to Amélie Riouxf{— YJ). A more detailed agenda and call-in details
will be shared shortly.

e In-person Board meeting. We wish to confirm that the next in-person Board meeting will take
place Tuesday-Wednesday, 5-6 May 2020, in Geneva. The meeting will be an important
opportunity to further discuss strategic issues as well as a draft of the annual report. We will

communicate further on logistical details.

As always, thank you for your support and continued engagement.
