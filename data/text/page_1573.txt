Subject: Collection of COVID-19 patient data from medical records

  

Tony, Bob and Debi,

Amy is working on a pathway to collect data from electronic medical records in selected areas of the
country (addressing all of the appropriate privacy concerns). We’re looking for data elements to collect
and wonder if your teams could give us some insight from a public health perspective. | am copying
Amy to see if she has anything else to add. Perhaps you could assign someone to work with Amy.
Thanks

Steve
