We’ll add him to our calendar for 10:15a et.

If we needed to move him his segment to the 9a et hour would

May | have your cell number for my records?

Hi Janelle

We can make this work - it would need to be from between 10
am - 1020 am hard stop.

Will that work?

It would need to be from our NIH Readycam studio with
Videolink

Let me know if that works
