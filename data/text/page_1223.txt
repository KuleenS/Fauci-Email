Dear Dr A. Faucy,
we don't know each other. I was bom [© T ama simple doctor in

Medicin and live in a remote Italian region. I am no one. I trust in God that you can read my
paper, being published. I send it to you to anticipate the exit times because I trust that we can
really understand what Covid 19 is. Being nobody, I did what nobody would have done. I used
the few tools I had available and questioned all the papers and data published so far. I describe
what the dual mechanism of the Covid-19 can be. I anticipate that the result conclusion: is not
to my credit but I have been helped. I wish you a good read. May God bless us.

Sincerely with love,
