Dear Dr. Fauci,
|am so happy to continue seeing you in press conferences and on news broadcasts.

Please keep making those public appeerances. Americans need to hear the facts from someone who is
trustworthy.

lam sure that tiptoeing around Donald Trump has dramatically complicated your life. | hope that you
will find ways to “correct” or “clarify” the constant stream of misstatements that he makes — our lives
depend upon it. (Maybe Trump could wear a hazmat suit — to protect his fragile ego from any possible
bruising caused by a collision with the truth. Just kidding.)

Seriously, Doctor, it is a huge relief to see and hear you and your expert colleagues. It is to the point that
we cannot believe a single word that comes out of Trump’s mouth.

Very sincerely,
Elizabeth Stevens
