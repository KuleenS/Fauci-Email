Hi Dr. Fauci -- | also should have added that we are happy to pre-tape the interview so it does not
have to happen on April 23. In order for it to run on that date, we would love to record it some time
Wed during the day or on Thurs morning. Hoping that helps with timing. and looking forward to
hearing from you. Best, Alice
