Hi Patricia,

This is Querry Robinson with Nicolle Wallace at MSNBC’s ‘Deadline: White House’ in New
York again.

lam writing to request an interview with Dr. Fauci today during the 4 pm ET or at some
point next week if his schedule may allow.

Nicolle is hoping to speak with Dr. Fauci about growing concerns over the spread
coronavirus and what the public should be doing now in the wake of this pandemic.

We would gladly have Dr. Fauci join us from the NIH camera if his schedule may allow..

Please let me know if today may be a possibility or if another day next week may be better
for the schedule when you may have a moment.

All the best,

NIH-000924
