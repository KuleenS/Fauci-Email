Subject: Washington Post fact check on Fauci/scientists story

Hi Patty,

Thanks very much for your help yesterday and hope you’re doing well. We’re working ona
story today about Trump’s relationship with the scientific and medical experts in the
coronavirus response, including Dr. Fauci. We’re reporting this out today but wanted to
send you what we've been hearing as we get it so there’s ample time to fact check
everything today. Here are some points we'd love to discuss with the best person in your
office or, better yet, Dr. Fauci himself.
