come it for the test.

I've instructed my family and, recently (after family), close
friends to get some Alvesco (ciclesonide) for emergency use
only. I've been told by colleagues on the front-line in Japan,
China, and Korea, and found several pre-print papers, that it is
an effective treatment for late-stage COVID-19 patients. Some
patients on ventilators who were approaching death have fully
recovered after treatment with ciclesonide; ciclesonide has much
smaller particles than other corticosteroids so it reaches deeper
into lungs and alveolis) . Also, the treatment seems to be a
potent suppressor of virus replication. Recovered patients have
tested negative shortly after the treatment. Of course, data is
limited so can't be sure the treatment is effective. However,
because Alvesco has been shown to be safe for infant - 100+
year-old patients, I'm ok with my family and I having it for
emergency use. That is, only if healthcare facilities are unable to
accept them or me as a patient to treat with ventilator,
