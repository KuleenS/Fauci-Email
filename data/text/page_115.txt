ASF:

Attached please find a proposed background briefer for the visit to the VRC (big thanks to John, Barney,
Kizzmekia , the rest of their team and Andrea and Greg). We focused on the VRC itself and the mRNA
candidate, figuring that the VPOTUS office would have a tick tock etc. VRC also prepared talking points
for the round table should those be requested (I have those if you’d like to see them now, but so far the
White House has not asked for this).

Available by cell. [OG
