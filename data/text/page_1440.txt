| would be happy to talk to him about Shelly. People like to make stories as opposed to
reporting ona story. Shelly was one of my best friends and mentor, but | was me way before |
met Shelly, and so | am not really sure what he means by saying that Shelly “...helped turn Dr.
Fauci into the person he is today”.
Best,
Tony

Of course the reason | am asking is that it is presumptious for me to talk to him about shellys influence
on you....perhaps | should just refer him to you?

Don’t want to do anything either inappropriate, non helpful or what you don’t what. Best bart

Dr. Haynes,
I'm a reporter from the Wall Strect Journal and, more important, a friend of Ben's from Duke.

I've written quite a bit about your mentor and friend Dr. Fauci in the last few weeks, and I'm
working on another story now that I was hoping you might be able to help with.
