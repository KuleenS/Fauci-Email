First live stream/podcast now with Chinese interpretation. URL below.

Second live stream/podcast will be put up tomorrow. URL below.

Couple big thank yous from prominent science writers — NYT/WSJ — said learned more listening to you
for 30 minutes then everything they read in the last few weeks.

My response when you have a very wise scientist, who hears the question and answers the question,
and has 40+ years of experience we should listen and learn.

Be well.
