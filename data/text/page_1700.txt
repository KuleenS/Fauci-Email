Dear Dr. Anthony S. Fauci,

My name is Brendan Taglianetti; | am a Full-Time Advanced EMT provider for Milford
Ambulance Service in Milford, NH. | want to help relay your message of COVID-19 information for state
of New Hampshire, by conducting a Facebook Live chat with myself to project information and messages
to the citizens of New Hampshire. This is a chance for us to chat for around 10 minutes and talk with a
first responder to the general public.

| have seen you do interviews with the media/ daytime talk shows, a Facebook live chat with
Mark Zuckerberg, and even an Instagram live video with Stephen Curry from the Golden State Warriors.

| run the social media aspect of the department, and | would love to do a 10-15 minute discussion (with
information to the public, as well as some question and answer) with you on Facebook (live) to have the
general public watch us talk about the pandemic and the next steps, and also maybe take some
questions asked of the public watching when they comment. | also will be reaching out to the New
Hampshire State Governor Chris Sununu and Dr. Benjamin P. Chan (who is the state’s epidemiologist). |
would love to have them chat with me, and have you join in on the discussion as well. | have no
confirmed with them if they are available yet, but | am putting things in motion.

| know that if | was able to set up a time and date that would work around your busy and
important schedule, then | could with ample time promote it. | would love to not only get the town on
Milford to watch this, but have the state of New Hampshire and other states nearby tune in. | know this
is along shot and that you have way more important aspects of your job to complete, but | think this an
important time to have the public hear you talk.

Please let me know if this could be possible and | would love to set this up, | don’t expect to
take too much of your time if this can happen. Sometimes in life you just need to ask and see what
happens and this is a time where that risk is worth it to have a conversation with you about this
pandemic we are facing, especially as we ramp up for starting to “peak” in the number of people
affected.
