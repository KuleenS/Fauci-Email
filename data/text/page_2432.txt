Subject: a question

Dr. Fauci,

May | suggest a question that you might ask of COVID-19 identified
patients? Could you ask them if they had received a current flu shot for this
season? Since the COVID-19 corona virus basic construct is a basic flu
version with a bio-engineered HIV or other(?) component, is it possible that
our flu vaccines might have some degree of protection against this new
COVID-19 viral construct? | think it is important to ask this question!

Dr. Len Trudell
