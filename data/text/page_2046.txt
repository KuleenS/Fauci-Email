Subject: Covid-19 coverage in Nature Reviews Immunology
Dear Tony,

Thank you again for contributing the fabulous year in review article to Nature reviews Immunology last
year!

Given the current pandemic, we can only imagine how incredibly busy you are at the moment. At Nature
Reviews Immunology we have decided that we would like to introduce an in-brief section that provides
a brief overview of the most notable/important research on SARS-CoV-2, particularly with regards to its
immunopathology and vaccine development. To this end, we are recruiting a small number of advisors
to point us in the right direction — this would involve no actual writing, just sending us references to the
papers as and when they come out. Would you, ora member of your team, be willing to act as an
advisor for this project, by sending us between 1-5 references for notable papers per month? We feel
that particularly in this fast evolving situation, itis of paramount importance that amongst the deluge of
data, scientists are guided towards the most important papers.

| look forward to hearing from you,
With best regards,

Alexandra

Dr Alexandra Flemming
