| hope you are having a good weekend.

Quick question: Would you be OK if I/we reached out to Joe
Menetski, who | understand leads many of the ACTIV efforts.
We have come to know Joe very well as a great collaborator on
the AMP gene therapy initiative and It would be very easy |
think working informally with Joe to look a bit more under the
hood and identify/ map opportunities for alignment with the
other initiatives.

All the Best,
Morten
