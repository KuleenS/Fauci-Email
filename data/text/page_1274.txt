To this end, M. FRANCHOMME confirmed to me this: / am at the disposal of your authorities
to provide and explain a protocol based on essential oils.

His email address is :( OE)

In terms of a double-blind placebo clinical study, there is, as of today, a huge cohort of
hospitalized patients, a significant portion of whom | suspect would be enthusiastic about
voluntary enrolment.

For patients in critical care with a life-threatening prognosis, it is undoubtedly possible, given
the circumstances, to bypass the usual research protocols and offer a last-resort treatment to
these patients in an attempt to save their lives, with their permission or that of their legal
representatives in case of temporary or permanent incapacity.

Even if it doesn’t work, | don’t think patients or their loved ones will blame your government
for trying everything, but if you don’t, | wouldn’t like to be in your shoes!

Cordially,

Benoit Ponton
