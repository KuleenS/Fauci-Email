Subject: RE: Coronavirus vaccine
Hi Tony,
It’s been nice hearing you on the various press conferences...can’t believe we’re still both doing this.

Have a question about something Redfield said in Friday in the White House briefing about nCoV. He
said using their PCR assay, the virus can be detectable one day, then not the next, then detectable.

I’m curious about this. | see a few possibilities:

. The test isn’t as sensitive as CDC hopes

. The sample was taken from different places

. With low viral titer, it may seem like the virus “disappears” from one day to the next.

. The virus may be hanging out in the terminal bronchioles, and only pop up to the upper
respiratory system from time to time.

PWN

Am | on the right track? Would you have a few minutes today to record an interview with me?
