country, about the countless deaths . Your advice to the president has proven really important to prevent the spread
of the disease, however, in this nation, there is another epidemic based on lies and self-interest , now the people
behind the fake news are targeting to you, one example is the post of an email that relates to you with the former
Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. This is why I decided to write a letter of support, I am sick of fake news,personal
attacks and violation of the First Amendment , the right to have an opinion,to civil servants serving this country.
