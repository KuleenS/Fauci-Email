Subject: Coronavirus Antigen Microarray
Hi Cassandra,

Happy Day! | am excited to let you know that Sino Biological just released Coronavirus antigen
Microarray (CoVAM) which belongs to our Sinommune™ Multiplex Antigen Microarray product line. You
may get more details from the following link:

httos://www.sinobiological.com/research/virus/coronavirus-arra

Currently the standard pre-printed CoVAM array is sold in the unit of slide, 16 arrays/slide. In each array
there are 65 antigens related to the viruses that can cause upper respiratory tract infections including
the most recent SARS-CoV-2. The list price is $3,200/slide. Please contact me for how to place the order
if you are interested or need more information.

So far, this array has mainly been used for two purposes: 1) Sero-surveillance studies of COVID-19
infection, and 2) Evaluating antibody reactivity in animals (monkeys and mice) after vaccination. Please
be advised that our array is for research use only (RUO), not for the diagnostic purpose which needs the
FDA approval.

After you run the samples on the slide, you may read the slide on the following compatible machines:
