Hi Patty,
Hope all is well and that your 2020 is off tc a good, if no doubt, busy start.

Contacting you directly because you have always been my best “go to” person when it comes to Tony and activities
at the Institute. Hope you can be of help again.

I would like to do a Public Health Grand Rounds session on the coronavirus here at our Aspen DC offices —
hopefully on February 11 (from 12 until about 1:15pm; lunch is made available to attendees). Ron Klain, former
Obama Ebola czar -- is available -- and hope Tony might be as well. Tony and Ron are my first two choices.
Perhaps we might add someone from CDC. I suspect we could get some good press, especially if Tony is in the
lineup.

Know how terribly busy Tony ts, but hope this might be a possibility. Any chance?
As always, many thanks —

All best,
Ruth
