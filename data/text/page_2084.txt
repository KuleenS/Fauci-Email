Dear Dr Fauci:

Apologies for further burdening your staff at this time of Covid19 crisis, by submitting
this question.

Fox News' Host Steven Hilton posed a question to you on his March 15th program: my
understanding of it - which my wife and I, f @) Gj, believe to be a "good"
question - is as follows:

"Given the relative safety of all but the elderly and those whose immune systems are
compromised, and that they are far fewer than the rest of the population, why not
quarantine only theme"

Mr Hilton says he believes there to be an answer, but it's not yet been given to the
public. For what it's worth, I too believe there's an answer. I'm less certain that it's not
been given. Below is the link to this matter on the Fox website.

answer-the-big-question-americans-are-asking

Thanks for such attention as this may be given. If in the present circumstances, that
means none, I get it; nothing further is necessary or expected.

Happy to try to provide anything further which is needed or helpful.
Sincerely,
