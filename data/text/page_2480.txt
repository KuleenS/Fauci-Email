As the leader of the World Health Organization team that visited China, Dr. Bruce Aylward feels he has
been to the mountaintop — and has seen what's possible.
During a two-week visit in early February, Dr. Aylward saw how China rapidly suppressed the
coronavirus outbreak that had engulfed Wuhan, and was threatening the rest of the country.
New cases in China have dropped to about 200 a day, from more than 3,000 in early February. The
numbers may rise again as China’s economy begins to revive. But for now, far more new cases are
appearing elsewhere in the world.
China’s counterattack can be replicated, Dr. Aylward said, but it will require speed, money, imagination
and political courage.
For countries that act quickly, containment is still possible “because we don’t have a global pandemic —
we have outbreaks occurring globally,” he added.
