Dear Tony,

This note is between long time colleagues.

This entire Coronavirus story, and the handling of it, has really escalated into an unexpected journey. I want you to
know how much I have respected you professionally and medically for nearly 20 years. I also want you to know that
I have appreciated how we have communicated through the years about threats to our world’s health and how
honest and transparent you have always been. | know you are in a unique situation and | want you to know that I
respect that and would never put you in a situation with my correspondence that would jeopardize you in anyway.
With that said, I] hope you can keep me informed, off the record if need be, so I can continue to cover this story
honestly and fairly.

With utmost respect,

Kyra
