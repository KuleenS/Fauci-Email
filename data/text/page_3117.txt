| have gone over the document and have made a number of tracked changes. In addition, for
ease of reading | have accepted all the tracked changes and am sending a clean copy. Hence
there are 2 attachments: 1) one with all tracked changes; 2) a clean copy accepting all

on when this goes out we need to make sure that the official number is 11 and not still
8Thanks!

Subject: Fauci/Redfield op-ed for review
Dr. Fauci —

Attached is the draft op-ed for your review. Greg, Hilary and | have added proposed edits in track
changes. We will send back to CDC/HHS one document with all NIAID edits in track changes. HHS would
like to get a draft to the White House at some point this evening.

Thanks,
Jen
