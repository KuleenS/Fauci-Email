Subject: Advice re a donation

Hi Sylvia
| hope this find you well.

Quick question, a little bit from left field, but drawing on your
experience at Gates and HHS. Ray Dalio and Bridgewater are
interested in making a very sizable donation to help China deal
with the global public health challenge arising from the new
coronavirus. Any suggestions of where we should look to
donate the funds?

Thanks so much. [C0 Looking

forward to seeing you again soon.
