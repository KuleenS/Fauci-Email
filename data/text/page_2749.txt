5. If someone wishes to travel to China to work on the live virus, are there any travel restrictions
other than the self isolation/quarantine already in place (and of course subject to change over
time)?

Thank you very much for your help with these important questions as we all try to do our best to
contribute solutions to this health crisis.

With best regards,
Linda
