Greg;

| am attaching 2 documents: 1) The revised manuscript that you sent to me in which I have
added a number of tracked changes including deleting a substantial amount to get it between
800 and 900 words; and 2) A clean version where | have accepted all the tracked changes (yours
and mine. Right now | like it the way it is and would not change it much if at all. What it needs
now is references. Can you add up to 10 references? It might be easier for you to do that
rather than Cliff. If not, | will send to Cliff and see ifhe can doit. In the meantime, | will send it
without references to Bob Redfield for his review/approval. Let us discuss by phone if you
wish.
Thanks,
Tony
