Subject: Great videos!

Congratulations to all of you who made today’s COVID-19 videos a tremendous success! | know there
were a lot of quickly moving, intricate parts and it went off flawlessly—all remotely, to boot! Everyone
worked as a team, under very tight timelines, and thanks to Renate, who orchestrated the FC Home
Edition! | know NIH staff will greatly appreciate the videos—they’re chockful of content! And special
thanks to Dr. Fauci, who took time out of his “leisurely” day to devote more than an hour to the
taping—incredible!

You all make us very proud!

John
