americans/2020/02/20/b6f54cae-5279-11ea-b119-4faabac6674f story.html

We'd like him on either on Saturday, in the 7:30am to 8am half hour, with Kendis
Gibson/Cori Coffin, or on Sunday in the 12pm or 1pm hour with Alex Witt. Whatever
day/hour that is good for him, we’ll make work.

Thank you so much for your help in this matter.
