Subj ect: Re: Urgent Email/Stratesy to attack 2019-nCoV coronavirus

Dear Dr. Fauci,

Following my previous email regarding our work on developing strategies to attack
the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, | am attaching in this email our experimental results
demonstrating that 2 nucleotide analogues are inhibitors of the SARS-CoV
polymerase. Since the SARS-CoV polymerase has over 96% similarity to the
polymerase from SARS-CoV-2, we expect that the nucleotide analogues, 2’-F,Me-
UTP and 3’-F-dTTP, will also inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase.

At this point, it is imperative that the prodrug forms (one is Sofosbuvir that is FDA
approved for HepC) of these molecules begin immediate in vitro testing with
infected cells (similar to the studies carried out for Remdesivir and chloroquine in
the Cell Research article at the link, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-
0282-0; PDF file of the article also attached) followed by animal testing trials
ASAP. Since we do not have access to the SARS-CoV-?2 viral strains, we need your
assistance to identify resources at the NIH laboratories to embark on this next step
