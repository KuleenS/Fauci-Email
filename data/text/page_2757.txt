Given the news of health care personnel in Wuhan and Hubei being infected, and
acute shortage of PPE for COVID-19, I posted these Q&A s on the ID Society
America "Science Speaks" website as the 10th in a series of my updates since
January 6th.

The final Question asks and answers that mass production of COVID-19 PPE
should occur now.
