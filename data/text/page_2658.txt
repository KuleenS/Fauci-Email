as they are ramping
up their capabilities to
care for patients with
COVID-19 presenting
anywhere in their
system. Staff
working in ERs and
ICUs are pretty
familiar with the care
of these types of
patients and the use of
appropriate PPE
(standard contact and
airborne precautions
including eye
protection). The staff
at the hospitals
undergo fit testing for
respirators, etc. Staff
in outpatient clinics
(especially remote
community based
outpatient clinics)
don’t typically
undergo fit testing for
respirators. So ERs
and ICUs have
muscle memory for
isolating patients and
providing care to
patients with
infectious respiratory
disease. Community
based outpatient
clinics do not.

As part of the
preparedness efforts,
there has been interest
in fit testing
outpatient clinic staff
and supplying these
clinics with PPE and
establishing
