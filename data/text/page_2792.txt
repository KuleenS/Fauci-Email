Hello,

Working as an occupational physician in France, I would like to draw your attention to the antiviral activity of
proton pump inhibitors, including for the Gibbon Ape Leukemia virus, a virus which does not require acidification
of endosomes for entry into cells, as is the case with coronaviruses.

Indeed, in 2015 Long ct al. (1) found that « ... The commonly used proton pump inhibitors, Omeprazole and
Esomeprazole were also able to inhibit entry of all PVs tested but at higher drug concentrations than may be
achieved in vivo... ».

Using omeprazole and esomeprazole magnesium hydrate, prepared in sterile DMSO (Sigma), they concluded that «
... OM and ESOM appeared to decrease fluorescence, and therefore increase endosomal pH, only at a concentration
of 200uM, higher than that required to inhidit PV entry. Moreover cellular toxicity was observed at this
concentration after 24 hours... ».

In 2016, Dowall et al. (2) found : « ... Whereas omeprazole and esomeprazole demonstrated in vitro activity against
EBOV, the results were in line with a previous report using pseudotyped viruses where the values of drug
concentration causing 50% inhibition (C50) were in the region of 50 pM [10]. This suggested that doses required
for potent inhibition would be difficult to achieve without concomitant and significant toxicity (the licenced dosing
for 40 mg esomeprazole, 20 mg esomeprazole and 20 mg omeprazole generates median maximum plasma
concentrations of 1.59—9.61 1M, 0.51—-4.78 UM and 0.15—3.51 4M, respectively... ».

However, omeprazole is marketed in a non-ionized form and must be ionized (in acidic environment) to be
