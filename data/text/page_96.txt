Subject: Report from 'HHS COVID-19 Situation Update’ call today

 

 

 

 

Passing on some main points from of an “HHS COVID-19 Situation Update” call that took place at 3pm
today, FYI.

e The meat of the call was a situation update by Nancy Messonnier (with epi numbers below).

e She noted that the national strategy is still containment.

e However, since there are some US locales with evidence of community spread, there is
consideration if some “community level action” may be appropriate, with a move towards a
blend of mitigation/containment in certain areas.

Global epi update:
China lab/clinically confirmed cases: 79,824 (+573 in last 24h)

China deaths: 2,870

61 international locations with 7,102 cases so far (Armenia, Ecuador, Ireland, Luxembourg new in last
24h)
