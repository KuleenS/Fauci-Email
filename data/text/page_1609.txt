The pharma group’s leaders also intend to offer resources to biotechs and
academic groups pursuing countermeasures who may not want to join the effort
but could benefit from expert guidance.

Flying the plane as they build it, the collaborators intend to create a clearing house
of ideas for testing of molecules and vaccines, with working groups to vet the ideas
and expedite testing on the most promising via clinical or preclinical testing.

According to the participants who spoke to BioCentury, the structure will probably
evolve over time. Currently, the model involves five working groups, for clinical
phase repurposing, novel small molecule antivirals, novel antibodies, preventive
vaccines and preclinical repurposing. Each will be headed by a pharma R&D
executive and will be responsible for prioritizing potential compounds and
specifying actions.

Two platform groups will integrate across modalities: a clinical trial acceleration
group and a data sharing group.

“This is not a time to think about proprietary information or IP or margins. We
need to break down the barriers and solve the problem,” said one participant
involved in the consortium.

Subject: RE: Reaching out about partnerships and COVID-19

Hi Paul,

| have done some work on the idea of an “AMP like” COVID project. As |
mentioned, Mikael Dolsten has been quite enthusiastic. For FDA, Peter Marks,
Janet Woodcock, and Steve Hahn were all extremely positive about this
opportunity for a shared consideration about priorities. Tony Fauci and his team
are totally in favor, and the FNIH (David Wholley and Maria Freire) stands ready to
serve as convener. | thought the first step would be a 90 to 120-minute virtual
meeting — hopefully next week. Attached is a draft precis of what this might look
like; | have left out the roster because that is very much a work in progress.

Meanwhile | saw reports that there are related partnership discussions going on
amongst pharmas: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-
