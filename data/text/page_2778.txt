Tell patients to avoid touching their eyes, nose, and
mouth.

Clear up confusion about masks. Emphasize that masks are
for SICK patients...to help keep their germs from getting into

the air.

But discourage surgical masks for most patients withOUT
symptoms...there’s no evidence they help. They’re too loose to
limit inhaling germs...and viruses can also get in through the

eyes.

If patients ask about N95 respirators, tell them these
require fitting and training before use. Save them for

healthcare workers.

Caution that unnecessary mask use may contribute to
shortages.

Continue to ask patients WITH respiratory symptoms to put a
surgical mask on when they come to clinic.

And suggest that sick patients wear a mask at home if in
close contact with infants, elderly, or immunocompromised
patients.

Tell patients to discard masks when damp...and to use a
fresh one at least daily.

Encourage patients to stay home when they’re sick.
