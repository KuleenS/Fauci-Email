Subject: Corona Virus and a possible path to a vaccine?

importance: High

Dear Dr. Fauci -

Thank you for helping millions of people with your research over the years.

The following information was culled from http://poleshift.ning.com.

Perhaps this article may help you and your colleagues develop a vaccine that may combat the Corona Virus.
You were the first one | thought of who may be able to deem its worth and explore its research for practical
purposes.

Some of the links have included nih.gov so maybe your colleagues have already read this.

With my limited medical knowledge, | have taken the liberty to highlight key points that seem important.

Wishing you and yours all the best for remaining healthy in Mind, Body & Spirit.

Warm Regards & Appreciation,

NIH-001009
