Subject: Questions on coronavirus vaccine
Dear Dr Fauci,
Trust this mail finds you well.

| have a few questions regarding the Moderna vaccine, which it would be great to get your
input on.

ls it true that trials of the possible vaccine will start in April, but that, even if the first study
is positive, the vaccine might not become widely available until next year because of the
need for further studies and regulatory clearances?

The company is characterizing this as a vaccine. Strictly speaking, what should it be
referred to as?

If you have time for a quick telephone call this morning as soon as you're able that would
be great.

Many thanks,
Hanna
