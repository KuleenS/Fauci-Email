Subject: Thrombotic phenomena in COVID-19

Gary:
In follow-up of our recent conversation regarding the growing evidence that the
extremely catastrophic course of many patients with COVID-19 seems to me
pathogenically associated with the findings of microthrombi in the lungs and
often a multisystem process resembling DIC. In addition, there have been
growing numbers of cases of individuals (some young and otherwise healthy)
who have had unexplained strokes, only to find out that they actually have
COVID-19.

 

 

Thanks.

 

Best,
Tony
