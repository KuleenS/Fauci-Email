Subject: Appropriations - second supp for cornavirus - professional judgement request

Hi everyone,

Jen Cama with DeLauro just reached out to request our professional judgement on a second
supplemental for the coronavirus. Below is her question. Would you let me know what | should tell
her?

Question: Does NIH, in its professional judgment, recommend any additional funding for coronavirus?

Thanks.

Michelle
