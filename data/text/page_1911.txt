Medical authorities in China have said a drug used in Japan to treat new strains of influenza
appeared to be effective in coronavirus patients, Japanese media said on Wednesday.

Zhang Xinmin, an official at China’s science and technology ministry, said favipiravir,
developed by a subsidiary of Fujifilm, had produced encouraging outcomes in clinical trials in
Wuhan and Shenzhen involving 340 patients.

“It has a high degree of safety and is clearly effective in treatment,” Zhang told reporters on
Tuesday.

Patients who were given the medicine in Shenzhen turned negative for the virus after a median of
four days after becoming positive, compared with a median of 11 days for those who were not
treated with the drug, public broadcaster NHK said.

In addition, X-rays confirmed improvements in lung condition in about 91% of the patients who
were treated with favipiravir, compared to 62% or those without the drug.

declined to comment on the claims.

Shares in the firm surged on Wednesday following Zhang’s comments, closing the morning up
14.7% at 5,207 yen, having briefly hit their daily limit high of 5,238 yen,
