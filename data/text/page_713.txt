So far in our 4 billion long history, there have been no airborne viruses or
bacteria. Yes, in the hollywood movie "outbreak" there was, but it was a
movie. Why hasn't it?

If it had existed, this planet would have been a dead planet without life. It
would have killed all living. It is possible that there is somewhere else in the
universe, but not here on planet Earth. Not now. Remember, this is not the
first time a new virus is spreading in the world. What is happening now has
happened earlier in our long history.

But people are die you say. Yes, but the virus don't kill them. The virus open
a "door" in the cell wall thats allows for bacterias, how always are present,
to invade the body and create an aggressiv bacterial superinfection. That's
what kills them. See,

Disease.
