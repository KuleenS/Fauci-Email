Francis, Tony —
Mike Levitt (Nobel prize in Chemistry, 2013) sent the attached modeling of the COVID-19 epidemic to
Mike Lauer. | don’t know if this will prove useful but wanted to pass it along in case.

He indicated that he was amazed to see how an Excel level analysis could allow him to predict the China
epidemic would end as early at 2-Feb and get what he considers the best estimates for case fatality

ratio. His first report from 2-Feb is attached as well as his most recent two-part report.
