Hello,

We’re all set for tomorrow! ©

Dr. Fauci is confirmed for a live segment at 10:15a et on Newsroom w/Poppy Harlow & Jim
Sciutto.

Please ensure he’s seated no later than 10:05a et. (the show is aware that Dr. Fauci has a
hard at 10:20a et)

Nyya Greene, cc’d on this email, will be your Atlanta based show point of contact
tomorrow.
Any issues or changes please don’t hesitate to reach out to her in the morning.

Monday’s segment will focus on latest Coronavirus developments: Dr. Fauci covered the
SARS outbreak almost 17 years ago- from what he’s seeing now with the Coronavirus, how
bad do think this could become? How does the Coronavirus compare/contrast with others
like Ebola or Zika? How effective are quarantines in situations like this? What, if any,
precautions should we be taking right now in Amcrica? Any thoughts/talking points you can
send over from Dr. Fauci evening would be super helpful.
