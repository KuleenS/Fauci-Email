Where is Dr. Fauci?

| know where Dr. Fauci is—! saw him on SNL—remarkably he looked like Brad Pitt—except [to many of
us] Dr. Fauci is better looking. Smile, wink Why? We look with our hearts

| remember someone asked Dr. Fauci [in jest] who would he like to represent him in a movie...Dr. F. said
Brad Pitt. Well—Dr. F. Your dream suggestion came true. But, in many of our hearts—NO ONE can take
the place of our beloved, well respected, honored Dr. Anthony Fauci!!!!

God Bless America, God Bless Dr. Fauci !!!
