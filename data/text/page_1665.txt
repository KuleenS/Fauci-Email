Thanks for the note. Since they both effected adequate quarantine, they are OK with each
other....orovided that they practice physical distancing with everyone else, i.e. 6 feet apart and
masks when out in situations where they cannot guarantee 6ft distance. With regard to your
second question, it is not a question of temperature, it is a question of what surface the virus in
on — stainless steel versus cloth, versus cardboard. Each of these have differ time frames of
survival of replication competent virus from a couple of hours to about 2 days.

Best regards,
Tony

Dr. Fauci,

You are doing a great job and I am sure that things must be very challenging.

Please let me know your thoughts on this, although I think I know the answer.

  
 

 

| Isit safe for them to

see each other at this point?

I was also wondering if it has been determined how long COVID-19 can live in a refrigerator or
freezer.

Thank you.
Stay Healthy.
