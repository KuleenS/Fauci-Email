All,

Please find attached the compiled sign-up sheet with IC POCs for the 12 themes, as well as updated
packets to match the shifts that were brought to our attention (attachments #1-3).

As areminder, please send the 2 page summaries for each theme (with combined budget), using the
attached template (attachment #4), to Jordan Gladman by April 20 at 12 pm. Thanks to you and your
staff for developing these!

Best,
