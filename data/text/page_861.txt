Importance: High

Dear Dr. Fauci,
Recent research has shown that SARS-CoV-2 plays havoc with NAD function within cells.

Other research has shown that NAD+ levels decline from aging and obesity, both significant factors in
Covid-19 severity. But it has also been demonstrated that NAD levels can be replenished through oral
administration of nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). NR in particular
has had several human studies demonstrating its safety and efficacy, and roughly 50 human studies
listed on clinicaltrials.gov for all manner of disorders.

There is at least one anecdotal report of dramatic improvement in a Covid-19 patient after
