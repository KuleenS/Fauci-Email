about coronavirus! an analysis you might want to read or share

Hello Dr. Fauci,

I would like to thank you for being one of the few honest and trustworthy scientific
voices
as the world and the US confront the challenges of coronavirus. I was recently sent
this thoughtful statistical analysis and thought you or one of your colleagues might
wish to see it.

best wishes, yours, Dr. Jonathan Fritz
