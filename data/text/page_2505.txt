Dear Dr Fauci, this is not an area of my expertise, but given the urgency of situation with the Covid-19
and some of our experiences with treating CART induced cytokine release syndrome in cancer patients,
just wanted to share this email with you in case you find it of interest. Dr Betts is my brilliant junior BMT
colleague at University of Minnesota. | realize this may be old news to you but wanted to share just in
case.

Warm regards

Steve Pavletic

Hi Steve,
This is an interesting paper from intensivists in Wuhan. The IF of the journal is 18 too.

Looks like covid-19 causes an IL-6 mediated CRS with myocarditis, which is associated with mortality
(more so than the pneumonitis).

This suggests we should be more concerned with getting tocilizumab for critically ill covid-19 patients,
rather than tamiflu and ARVT...

Do you have a friend at the CDC that could use this info?

Thanks, Brian
