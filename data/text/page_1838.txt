Hello Jon - Greetings frog) @. It has been a long time since
we last connected and talked about gene therapy, etc. and

responses in your interview with him in Science and to see his
ethical evaluation of He's CCRS editing experiment in China. I’m
not as generous to He as George seems to be and | think that
this work is clearly unethical. George inexplicably conjures up
the sad history of Jess Gelsinger and the effect of his death on
the evolution of the field of gene therapy. Happily, he’s right
about the fact that gene therapy is now proving itself in a
growing list of intractable diseases (underscored by the 2015
Japan Prize). That has happened because studies are now much
more carefully designed and carried out. But sadly, we are in an
environment in which some people conclude that human
medical manipulations - gene therapy, genome editing, stem
cell therapy - are ethical as long as they “work”. The rationale is,
“let’s do the study and if it works and doesn’t kill or otherwise
harm, it’s OK”. It’s not a post-factor evaluation that determines
if an instance of human experimentation is ethical and
permissible - it is the design of a study that determines if it is
ethical or not. George should be reminded of that fact and
should re-read the Helsinki declarations or similar codes of
human experimentation.

In any event, your interview was fascinating. Best regards,

Ted Friedmann
