Subject: FOR ASF REVIEW: Draft PR re: Phase 1 mRNA coronavirus vax launch

 

 

Good morning, Dr. Fauci,

Please find attached for your review a draft press release about the launch of the Phase 1 study
of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. We are tentatively planning to issue the release on Wed.,
March 11 once we’ve received confirmation that the first participant has been vaccinated. For
ease of reference, the following is the quote we have crafted for you:

“Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-z2 is an urgent

public health priority,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “This Phase 1 study, launched

|.”

in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.

Thanks,

NIH-000909
