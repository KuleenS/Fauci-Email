Tony, Thank you for the immense 24/7 contribution you are making to our nation. Your wife is right: Pls get more
sleep and meals! Before Easter tomorrow I am sharing this brief Old Testament story to which I gave a 2020
interpretation. Today’s IDSA posting I am emphasizing that simultaneous antibody and virus RNA tests should be
done on “relapsed” or “reinfected” Covid-19 patients e.g., South Korea (N=91), China, elsewhere. I am looking
forward to giving NIAID Grand Rounds May Ist with Barney Graham and John Beigel. Danf{__ OV ©
