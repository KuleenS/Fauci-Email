Dr. Fauci:

In preparation for the upcoming COVID-19 hearings of the House Committee on
Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee and the Senate Committee on Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions, we have drafted the attached NIAID insert for
inclusion in the combined HHS statement for the record. The Department plans to
use the same combined statement for both the House and Senate hearings.
