Subject: Coronavirus on surfaces

Hello Dr Fauci,

I am trying to find out how long the coronavirus can remain infectious on the
surface of an object handled by someone with the virus.

My concern is with purchasing items for my jewelry shop that come from China ,
South Korea, and Turkey.

I have not been able to find anything that addresses this question and hope you can
clarify this for me. Thank you.

Sincerely yours,
Deborah Greene
