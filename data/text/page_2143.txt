Dear Dr. Fauci,

I have a question which has been troubling me since we began checking people’s
temperatures. 7 ~ @y(6]. I have
seen the temperature cutoff is 99.5F. | ©) 6)
| J) I
doubt very much that in screening people the question is asked them whether they
have taken a medicine for pain or for fever in the last 24 hours. I am a nurse and
many people do realize that the common pain relievers also relieve fevers. Should
we up our game and do better at screening?

You seem to be the wisest person on the government task force for the Coronavirus.
I hope this reaches you.

Thanks,
Kathy Quinlan

P.S. Please practice social distancing during the White House briefing,etc. It is hard
to watch all of you people bunched around the President and telling the public to
stay 6 feet apart. If you do it maybe the others will follow suit.
