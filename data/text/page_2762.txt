As a participant you and your spouse are also invited to join us
for our special reception, dinner and speaker at the REACH
(Kennedy Center) on Thursday, February 20 at 6:30pm. It is the
best opportunity for you to meet our CEO members and
spouses, speakers and other special guests in an informal
atmosphere.

If you are interested and available, please let me know. We can
also set up a very brief call with you to discuss any additional
details and answer any questions you may have. We look
forward to hearing from you and would be honored to have you
participate with us again.

Warmest regards,

Marlene
