Could the Coronavirus mutate, if a vaccine cannot be found in time?

We are learning more about the novel coronavirus every day. At this time, we are not aware of any
mutations that might affect vaccine development. Based on our experience with other coronaviruses,
including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it is unlikely—but not impossible—that the novel coronavirus will
mutate in a way that would have an impact on the development of medical countermeasures. We are
continuing to monitor this.

Will the vaccine be the solution against Coronavirus?

A safe and effective vaccine would be an extremely valuable tool to help stop the spread of infection
and prevent future outbreaks. However, proven public health practices of identifying cases, isolating
patients, and tracing contacts must continue alongside a vaccination program.

Thanks,
