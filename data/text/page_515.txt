Dr. Fauci,

Infants and children infected with CoVid-19 seem to be an anomaly. Could it be as simple as childhood
vaccinations? Are Chinese children vaccinated with anti malarial drugs such as Chloroquine phosphate, which is
proving effective in older patients for CoVid-19?

If infants and children are not getting severe infections, why?
