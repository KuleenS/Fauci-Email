New virus cruise ship disembarks and kills two Japanese
passengers in hospital

February 20, 2020 11:38

Two Japanese men and women in their 80s who were hospitalized and
treated for the virus were killed on the 20th in a cruise ship passenger who
was confirmed to be infected with the new coronavirus. This is the first time
a cruise ship passenger has died and three people have been killed in the
country.

As of the 19th, 621 cruise ships out of approximately 3,700 crew members
and passengers on the cruise ship where outbreaks of the new coronavirus
were confirmed were confirmed.

According to government officials, two of them, a 87-year-old man and an 84-
year-old woman, died on the 20th.

Both were Japanese and had a basic illness and were confirmed to have been
infected with the virus, so it was said that men were hospitalized on the 11th
of this month and women on the 12th to be treated.

This is the first time a cruise ship passenger has died.

In addition, three people have been killed in Japan, following the death of a
woman in her 80s living in Kanagawa Prefecture on the 13th of this month.
