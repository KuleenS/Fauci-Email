Dear Dr. Fauci,

Thank you for your service and your honesty.

It is difficult for me to watch you telling the truth with all of the people of the
Trump Administration spouting lies constantly!

Keep up the good work!

Our prayers are with you and those who are working to help this country
deal with this coronavirus.

Sincerely,

Sonja C. Lightbody
