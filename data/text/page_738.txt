Hi Morten,

Thanks for your note. It would be great to have this connection — but
let me suggest that you start with David Wholley (cc’d here), as he
oversees all four of the ACTIV working groups. Joe is the program lead
for the group on preclinical therapeutics/repurposing.

Best, Francis

Subject: OK to contact Joe Menetski to discuss opportunities for alignment/
collaboration on ACTIV activities?

Francis,
| hope you are having a good weekend.

Quick question: Would you be OK if I/we reached out to Joe Menetski, who |
understand leads many of the ACTIV efforts. We have come to know Joe very
well as a great collaborator on the AMP gene therapy initiative and It would
be very easy | think working informally with Joe to look a bit more under the
hood and identify/ map opportunities for alignment with the other initiatives.

All the Best,
Morten
