Marty:

Thanks for the note. Indeed, immune sera is foremost on our mind as are mAbs. Hope that all
is well with you.
Best,
Tony

Dear Tony,

| dont mean to bother you, but I have a suggestion, in case you have not
considered it.

China will have hundreds of thousands of Coronavirus survivors. Their convalescent
(immune) serum is valuable. China should try to collect it and give it as a good-will
gesture to people around the world.

For moderately to seriously ill people, Immune serum should save many lives.

If cases start to come here, we also should collect serum from survivors, but
hopefully we will be very late in the pandemic, and it is not needed because of all
of the others things you are doing.

Thank you for everything you and NIAID are doing!

Best wishes, Marty

(Just as in SARS, the Ro for nCo-2019 is higher in hospitals than in the community,
but it still is too high in the community).
