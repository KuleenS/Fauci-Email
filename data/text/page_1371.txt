Subject: NEWS: Congressional letter to Peace Corps, CNCS, and FEMA on COVID-19 Response Corps

 

Hi all,

Big news. Herewith is a letter signed by 40 members of Congress asking FEMA, Peace Corps, and
AmeriCorps to form a “COVID-19 Response Corps.” This is now in the public domain. Press release
forthcoming.

Please save the time for Zoom call 8 am tomorrow on next steps.

The National Peace Corps Association is hoping to create and fund a group that draws on the evacuated

volunteers and their skills to respond to the COVID-19 crisis in the United States. Workers would take on

work like tracing the contacts of diagnosed individuals, monitoring the health of those in quarantine and
staffing call centers. An agency such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention or AmeriCorps could potentially manage the group, says Blumhorst, who
has been advocating for the project. Salaries could come from funding that's already been allotted to the
COVID-19 response but hasn't yet been spent. The NPCA has discussed the idea with the offices of several

members of Congress that are receptive and supportive, Blumhorst says, and they're planning to speak
with more congresspeople and federal agencies and also hope to draw public attention to this potential
project.
