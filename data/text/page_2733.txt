possible. We (NIAID/ USG) do not expect to be the only source, but will likely be one of the main
sources for this research resource based on experience with Zika.

5. If someone wishes to travel to China to work on the live virus, are there any travel restrictions other
than the self isolation/quarantine already in place (and of course subject to change over time)?
For that, contacting CDC directly would make sense. If you would like us to inquire, we can. For high
consequence viruses, use of proper PPE has been a mitigating factor in quarantine consideration.

Please feel free to contact me if you have additional questions.

Thanks,

Subject: RE: Institutional request for information

Linda:

There is a “sample sharing” working group involving NIH and CDC. | have
copied both Hilary Marston and Alan Embry from NIAID who are involved in this
group and will ask them by this e-mail to respond to items #1 through 4.
Regarding returning travelers from China (item #5) if in Wuhan (Hubei province)
within previous 14 days, they submit to institutional quarantine; if in non-Hubei
province part of China, then they face self-isolation.

Hope that this is helpful.
Best regards,
Tony
