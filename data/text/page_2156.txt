Dear Dr. Fauci,

My apologies if you have already spoken with
Mike Maron, but it seems the political machine
here in New Jersey is ignoring our own medical
experts and | thought it important that your
team be aware of how this crisis is manifesting
on the front lines:

With infinite respect for you and the daunting task you face,
