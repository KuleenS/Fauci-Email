Dr. Fauci,

| have been so very heartened and impressed with your forthcoming and rational communications and actions
around the COVID-19 crisis. This includes your insistence on speaking truth to power and taking more aggressive
steps in this combat.

Don’t relent, and kecp up the great work. We all need you.

I wish you well.
