Dear Mr Fauci,

We are really wondering over here in Europe why you don’t take a dedicated opinion on COVID-19 and share your
opinion at the daily briefings to the extent of your personal believes.

We really expect you to oppose the presideat wherever you have a different opinion, which we believe is based on

facts.

Please consider our request and don’t let the president keep spreading his lies to the people of the United States.

We would really appreciate watching you on the briefings telling the nation the truth that is based on your

experience straight to the point.

Thank you so much,
Daniel Kolliker and acquaintances
