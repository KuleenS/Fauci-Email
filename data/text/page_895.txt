Subject: Re: Covid thrombi

Dear Tony,

| talked with Dr. Viecca this morning who shared additional information about his protocol. They started
from the pathological observation that all patients dying of Covid-19 pneumonia had diffuse pulmonary
microthrombosis. Since they detected almost exclusively white thrombi, they reasoned that they had to
block platelet activation/aggregation, while heparin would be ineffective at that stage. Thus, they
treated a first group of five critical patients with potent anti-aggregant therapy (Tirofiban/Aggrastat) and
apparently in all of them the pO2 started to rise within less than 2 hours, they got off the ventilators and

went on to full recovery. Viecca is an interventional cardiologist (OY

CF I sent copy of his protocol and contact information to Joe.

Let me know if | can be of any further help. All the best,

Paolo
