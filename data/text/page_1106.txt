Tony,

Hope you’re well and thank you again for all that you are doing. | got this out today in the New Yorker
and I'll be talking to most of the Democratic caucus today about what we’re doing in Mass and the
developing world.

Hang in there and let me know if there is anything more | can do. Mass is tough but we’re going to have
a 1000 contact tracers very soon. Every day we learn so much, which is why it’s so important for

everyone to get started.

Jim
