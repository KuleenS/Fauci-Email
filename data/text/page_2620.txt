The State Department was
unaware the individuals had
coronavirus when they were being
removed from the ship; they had
tested negative just a few days
before, Robert Kadlec, the
assistant secretary for
preparedness and response at the
U.S. Department of Health &
Human Services, said on a phone
call with reporters.

"If those results had come back
four hours earlier before we’d
started to disembark the ship and
before these people were evacuees
within an evacuation system, then
it would’ve been a different
discussion." Dr. William Walters,
director of operational medicine at
the U.S. Department of State, said
on the call.

Kadlec said that individuals
received multiple screenings when
moving from ship to bus to

plane and a more extensive
medical assessment upon arrival.

Two charter flights carrying

the Diamond Princess passengers
landed at military bases in
California and Texas overnight,
starting the clock on a 14-day
quarantine period to ensure those
passengers don’t have
coronavirus. In total,
approximately 380 Americans
were on board the Diamond
Princess ship for the duration of
the cruise and quarantine at sea.
