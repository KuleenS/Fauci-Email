Subject: ARB therapy in Covid-19 infection

Thank you for responding to my email yesterday about the possibility of ARB therapy
in treatment of coronavirus infection. | realize that your research is ongoing. Would you
anticipate, however, that the ARB with the most potential role in preventing virus
attachment would be the one that has the greatest affinity for the AT2 receptor? Am |
correct that losartan is the ARB with the lower receptor (AT1 vs AT2) selectivity and
might logically be the most promising ARB to investigate? Thanks. Dr Thomas Leopold
