Wuhan to add 19 additional hospital (when combined with the other 3
hospitals, this would add 30,000 beds).

Just to put that in perspective.

e There are 2.8 hospital beds in the US per 1,000 population.
e 30,000 beds is about the number of beds we would have for a
population of 11 M.

When you add the 30,000 beds plus the 13,348 other beds added (total
of 43,300 beds)

e There are 4.5 hospital beds in China per 1,000 population

e 43,300 beds is about the number of beds in China for a population of
9.6M

e Wuhan will have nearly doubled its bed capacity

How hard would that be for us to double bed capacity in any major US
city? (Really isolation beds for mild illness)
