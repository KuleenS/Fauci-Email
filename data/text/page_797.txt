Subject: Greetings from India

 

Dear Dr Fauci,

My greetings from India. | am a health economist and management professor at the Indian Institute of
Management, Ahmedabad, India's premier management school. Also, iam a avid fan of your work even
from pre-covid19 days.

| write to you requesting some time if possible to do a podcast of 45 minutes with you over zoom. The
science and policy ecosystem in India i think would immensely benefit if you can offer your thoughts on
what should be India's 12-month strategy going forward for COVID-19.

We have done some recent podcasts relatedly and they are listed her
(https://m.soundcloud.com/healthcastbycmhs/).

lf you agree, and we are flexible all of May, my communication head Mr. Deepak marked in the email
will arrange the zoom logistics and make it as seamless as possible for you.
