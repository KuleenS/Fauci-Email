Hi Dr. Fauci,

Please find attached for your review a draft press release announcing the launch of Dr.
Memoli’s serostudy to detect previously undiagnosed coronavirus infections. Your draft
quote is as follows:

“This study will give us a clearer picture of the true magnitude of the
COVID-19 pandemic in the United States by telling us how many people in
different communities have been infected without knowing it, because they had a
very mild, undocumented illness or did not access testing while they were sick,” said
Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., NIAID director. “These crucial data will help us measure
the impact of our public health efforts now and guide our COVID-19 response

moving forward.”

Thanks much,
Kathy
