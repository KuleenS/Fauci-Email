Subject: Surfactant Protein-D against coronavirus

Dear Dr. Fauci,

We are developing a recombinant human form of Surfactant Protein-D (AT-100), an
endogenous collectin with strong immune-modulatory propert properties. AT- AT-100 shows

anti-inflammatory and anti-infectious properties.

There are data indicating that SP-D clears c¢ coronavirus

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19439011 ).

   

While we are discussing this with a number of academic institutions, I was
wondering, though, whether you and the NIH are interested to collaborate on
evaluating AT-100 against coronavirus. Please let me know, if you are willing to
schedule a phone call with our Chief Medical Officer Dr. Paul Kingma and I to
discuss. There is obviously a sense of urgency behind this request.

Best regards,
