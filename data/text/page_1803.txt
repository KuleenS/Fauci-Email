Hi Tony, Hugh, and Emily
Hope you are doing well and getting a chance to pause (especially Tony!) after another breathless sprint
of a week.

The NIBIB community has unique capacity to design, build, and deploy an array of powerful biomedical
technologies. Much of our attention over the past year has been on early disease detection and
prevention, and the integration of digital/personal health with conventional medicine. The COVID-19
crisis seems to have many challenges that are ideally matched for our capabilities. With the S60M NIBIB
will receive in the supplement, we are in a unique position to make a contribution.
