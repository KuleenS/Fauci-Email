Tony,

It’s been so inspiring seeing you fight tirelessly against COVID-19, sticking to the facts and stepping up to
explain on a daily basis.

If there’s anything | can do to help from the world of emergency medicine beyond patient care, please
let me know. Whether that means taking on a new project or pushing my specialty organization, the
American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP). | sit on their board and keep looking for ideas to help
fight this pandemic.

Best wishes,
Erik
