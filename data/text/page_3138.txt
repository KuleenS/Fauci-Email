Patricia, hi, thank you so much for getting back to me and again, apologies to Dr. Fauci, | do
understand how swamped he.

With that said, I’ll confirm the exact time at around 2pm our time, but | think the interview
will be at approx 7:30am.

Would you like me to arrange transportation to and from the studio? We’d like Dr. Fauci to
be at the studio by 7:10am-ish?

Thank you so much. Shannah
