I wonder if the WSJ is interested in my OpEd. I am trying to get a message out that
convalescent serum (e.g. serum from people who recover) can be used to stem the coronavirus
epidemic if administered to exposed people. This has been known for over a century, and 1s
well accepted, but not widely known, even among experts today. There was one report that
China was beginning to stockpile serum but there has been almost no discussion of this option
among world public health authorities. Although | can get this published in a medical journal
my hope is to publish it instead in a venue of high readership since this is something that can
be done today to stem the epidemic. | am hoping that given the economic consequences of the
outbreak that the WSJ is interested. I included a brief bio below. Thanks for looking at this.
