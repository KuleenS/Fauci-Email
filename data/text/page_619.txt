Subject: NBC News Inquiry

 

Hi there,

I’m reaching out on behalf of NBC National News — would you be able to confirm that 44 Americans
aboard the Diamond Princess cruises ship have tested positive for coronavirus?

Also, would you be able to say where the Americans are staying as they are being treated for the virus?
Please REPLY ALL with your response, or give us a call at (212) 664-5222.

Thank you,
Colin
