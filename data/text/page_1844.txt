Subject: with love from Italy

Dear Doctor Fauci. My name is Rita Apgar and if by chance you noticed my last name, as my father said
many years ago, ‘f_ " | have lived in Italy for almost 50 years
and the sagacious finger of destiny pointed my way to Italy, the true home of my heart, although not a
drop of Italian blood flows through it. But the love of Italy and the Italians pumps through my heart
every second of my existence.

That sagacious finger of destiny pointed the way, and | followed it in faith tof OG
where | had lived. As soon as | set foot for the
first time in the house in this funky ghost town of a medieval village, | felt that we belonged together.
And, practically speaking, at the time, it was the perfect solution to some weighty personal problems.
Heart and mind were in peaceful agreement.

| have a dear friend who is an infectious disease specialist at the hospital in Asti. She is, obviously,
extremely busy these days but she took the time to call me Sunday evening and we talked about you.
She said to me, " you know, when | was just a graduate student, | was a secret groupie of Dr. Fauci, and
once when he was at a meeting or a conference or something (I'm not sure where or when) | was able to
ask him a few questions." | was thrilled, of course, since | also try to watch every appearance you make
on TV. | will not add anything in this regard.
