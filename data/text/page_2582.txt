Global Affairs says the departure date for a plane that will carry Canadians
home from a coronavirus-stricken cruise ship in Japan is yet to be confirmed.
Spokeswoman Barbara Harvey says the departure will be settled once final
arrangements are made with the Japanese government and the cruise ship
company. A news release from the company operating the Diamond Princess
cruise ship says the Canadian flight has been “shifted” to early Friday
morning.
