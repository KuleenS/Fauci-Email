Dear Professor Fauci,

I am Enrica Battifoglia of the Italian news agency ANSA, I already have had the pleasure to
interview you several times at the AIDS world conferences.

I would like to ask you some questions about Coronoravirus 2019-nCoV, to be published on the
ANSA Science web page (www.ansa.it/scienza), the main online science news resource in Italy
with over 1.5M contacts each month. I am sure that your clarity and competence will be highly

valuable to put some much-needed order among so many contrasting news and data, and would
be much appreciated by our readers.
