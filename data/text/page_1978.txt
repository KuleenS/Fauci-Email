Dear Tony,

I wanted to send our sincerest thanks from everyone at Science, for the superb leadership that
you are showing the United States (and the world) during this pandemic. Thank you also for
educating the public that the most productive countermeasures will be based on data-driven
science. We will continue to do our part here at Science to publish the strongest COVID-19
studies to help advance research as rapidly as possible.

All the best,

Priscilla
