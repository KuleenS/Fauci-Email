Deadline: COB today
Hi Patty,

This reporter is writing about the NCAA’s reaction COVID-19, and would like confirmation that the
following actually occurred:

Dr. Brian Hainline said two members of the NCAA’s advisory panel, Dr. Colleen Kraft and Dr. Del Rio,
spoke with Dr. Fauci, who said he would back the NCAA in its decision to cancel the tournament. That Dr.

Fauci “wholeheartedly” agreed and said to the NCAA reps, “Not only would he back us that this was the
right thing to do...he believed that all sports should make a similar call.”

The reporter would like a quick call/confirmation this evening, before they publish the story.
