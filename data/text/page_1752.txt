Hi Dr. Fauci,

I’m looking to do a quick 10 mimute phone interview on COVID-19. Pve seen your
interviews on CNN and they are very informative so I think you would be perfect
for our podcast.

This would be for a podcast available to faculty and students at Seneca Media
Department in Toronto.

Thanks,
