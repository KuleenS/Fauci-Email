Bedford’s analyses of RaTG13 and 2019-nCoV suggest that the two viruses shared a common ancestor
25 to 65 years ago, an estimate he arrived at by combining the difference in nucleotides between the
viruses with the presumed rates of mutation in other coronaviruses. So it likely took decades for
RaTG13-like viruses to mutate into 2019-nCoV.

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), another human disease caused by a coronavirus, similarly has
a link to bat viruses. But studies have built a compelling case it jumped to humans from camels. And the
phylogenetic tree from Shi’s bioRxiv paper (below) makes the camel-MERS link easy to see.

The longer a virus circulates in a human populations, the more time it has to develop mutations that
differentiate strains in infected people, and given that the 2019-nCoV sequences analyzed to date differ
from each other by seven nucleotides at most, this suggests it jumped into humans very recently. But it
remains a mystery which animal spread the virus to humans. “There’s a very large gray area between
viruses detected in bats and the virus now isolated in humans,” says Vincent Munster, a virologist at the
