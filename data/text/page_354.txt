Good afternoon,

| wonder if Dr. Fauci could join our program this evening at 10 pm to discuss the best
measures for the government and the American people to prepare for a coronavirus
pandemic.

Ali Velshi is hosting our show tonight on MSNBC.

This would be a panel discussion this evening — we’re still working through details of the
panel.

Interview would be from 10-10:20 pm EST.
Please let me know if anything would be possible tonight.

Many thanks,
Amy
