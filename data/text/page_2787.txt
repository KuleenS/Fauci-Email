but not in Vancouver--the Ro in North America became less than
one pretty quickly.

To me, one important aspect is the control of respiratory transmission in
the hospital, avoiding extensive nebulization/aerosolization, or doing so in
negative pressure rooms, as for TB isolation.

(Treating patients with robots is a good idea!)

In the community, standard public health quarantine, contact tracing should
be sufficient for starters.

Although hundreds of cases are reported in China, the actual number of
infections is likely much higher. The 41 deaths are the tip of the iceberg of
not 800 infections (5% fatality rate), but maybe 8,000 infections (0.5%).
Although that rate is much better, if the mutating virus becomes very
contagious—then the impact could be similar to 1918 flu. That’s why
containment 1s so important.—and although draconian, the Chinese
government is doing the right thing (as far as we know).

When a new pathogen arrives, children often have mild disease but they
are important vectors for transmission in the community, reaching many
households. The second paper is the importance of closing schools to minimize
transmission—This was for flu with a short (pre-symptomatic) incubation, but may
be even more relevant for 2019-nCoV. It is much too early to even think of this in
the USA, but it may come to this--and sooner will be better than later, when that
time point comes.

Happy to help, any way that I can. Thank you for all you and NIAID are
doing!!!
