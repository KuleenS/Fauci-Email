| Algorithm for addressing people with mild upper respiratory
symptoms in the age of Covid-19.

Hi Tony,
Thank you so much for calling me this morning, and for your terrific help last night tying to
think through the issue} }

Given our discussion this morning, | think it would be very helpful if the task force on
coronavirus came up with a clear algorithm for addressing issues related to people having
symptoms that could be from a cold, flu, or other virus - and not related to the virus that
causes COVID-19.
Let’s say there’s a hypothetical patient with some combination of sore throat, aches and
pain, low grade fever in the 99’s by mouth, and cough; there’s no shortness of breath. Let’s
say they are now proactively self-quarantined at home and are in the process of
evaluation. Questions include:
1. Who, if any, of the person’s contacts within the previous days should be
contacted?
2. If it’s only “close contacts” — those who were within 6 feet of the person for an
extended period of time:

a. What’s the definition of extended period of time?

b. Does any physical touching — such as a hug or handshake — immediately
mean there is significant contact?

c. How far back from the onset of the person’s illness do we need to check
for “close contacts?” This gets to the issue of how long before symptoms
begin can asymptomatic shedding occur.

3. If no Covid-19 testing is available or the person has been told they are not sick
enough for testing: how do we think about the potential risk to that person’s
contacts, for example, at home or work?
