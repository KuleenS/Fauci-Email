Thanks, Monique. Please have Andrew send the proposal to Cristina Cassetti (copied here) and
she can then brief me on it.

Dr. Fauci,

The nation again is fortunate to have your leadership for this latest public health emergency. Thank you
for all you are doing. I know you are extraordinarily busy, so I'll be brief.

I want to introduce you to MIT Sloan Professor Andrew Lo, a world leader in healthcare finance who has
focused much of his work recently on accelerating biomedical innovation via novel financing structures. I
have worked with him to explore financial engineering approaches to establish more durable public-private
partnerships for medical countermeasures. The persistent challenges you articulated at the Aspen Institute
event this week resonate loudly with Andrew and me.

He has proposal for COVID-19 that he would like to present to you. I defer to him to provide further
information.

Respectfully,
Monique
