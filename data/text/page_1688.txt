Importance: High

Dear Dr. Fauci,

| thought that you may be interested in reading this paper (Unless you already know about this of
course!). This is obviously a data-driven set of correlative observations, but could be worth looking
into.

| salute your outspoken efforts to galvanize this country into action in the midst of so many mixed
messages and dragging of feet.

Cheers,

david
