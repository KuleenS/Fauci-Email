Hello - Thanks for all for a very informative and sobering discussion last night. I've provided

also short. Doctors offices are closing for lack of PPE.

- each city is trying to solve these shortages in a short-term, piecemeal way. They need a longer-
term solution to stabilize availability. Outpatient settings are looking to health departments to
provide supplies, something HDs are not set up to do.

- testing in most places still requires PPE use (e.g. no availability of anterior nasal swabs) and the
PPE shortages are severely limiting testing scale up.

- even at hospitals, supply limitations make re-opening elective surgeries and other procedures
impossible at this stage.

- If considering re-opening businesses, this will drastically increase PPE needs to a whole new
sector.

TESTING challenges:

- Each city reported that, despite improvements, a very limited number of tests are being
performed compared to need.

- Supply shortages are the biggest challenge: swabs, PPE, sample kits, reagents are
the biggest obstacles. Not clear where this is going to come from or who is responsible
for addressing problems.

- Private labs limit number of sample kits distributed each week. In places where public
labs are available, there is a push to get providers to use the public labs. But many
places don't have public labs.

- There is no clear guidance on how to prioritize who gets tested first. So, in some places, that
means that people at lower-risk are being testing but people at greater risk (due to symptoms,
