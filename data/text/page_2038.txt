Subject: Fabric Face Masks

Dr Fauci,
Thank you for your guidance and expertise at this difficult time.

My friend and | are quilters. She lives inf@)@ and | live irf{_____ J. She has created a pattern for
a fabric face mask. We read Dr. Tufekci’s op ed in the NYT yesterday and have been brainstorming
together ever since on ways we can help.
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.htm|

Several years ago | mobilized quilters throughout the US and we raised more than $1.1 million for
Alzheimer's Disease research. All grass roots, all volunteer. There are 7-10 million quilters in the US.

My friend and | would like to make a fabric face mask pattern available at no charge so that quilters,
sewers, and crafters can make face masks. We understand these are nowhere near medical grade, but
they would be better than nothing at all. (See research cited in link above.) They would be made from
fabric scraps and supplies on hand; no trips to the fabric store would be necessary.

At this time there are no masks available to the public at all. Sewing for a cause would give purpose to

those of us staying home. Wearing a mask on rare occasions when we do venture outside has the
benefits signaling others to step back even if the masks do not protect against transmission of the virus.
