FYI — per request below, HHS is setting up a daily data call. We need to tell them at 9am what
you are going to discuss at the daily press conference at the end of the day. My observation is
that this may be hard to predict. However, we can certainly come up with some boilerplate
talking points that we re-submit every day, emphasizing the importance of properly designed
clinical trials as the best way to identify treatments.

Hi Courtney -

| hope you’re having a good weekend. Just wanted to touch base because starting tomorrow, we will be
receiving requests for information from Staff Sec each evening ahead of the next day’s press conference
- for a turnaround by 9am the following morning. Staff Sec is requesting feedback (see the questions
below) from task force experts, including Dr. Fauci, on information they recommend be included in the
next day's press conference.

Could you please help me identify a primary POC at NIAID that | can work with to get information to Staff
Sec?
