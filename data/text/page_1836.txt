Dear Tony: | sent a brief note to my friend Jon Cohen to congratulate him on what | thought was his fine
interview with you. In his response, he suggested that | should send a copy to you. I’ve been a little
reluctant to do that because of what | assumed must be a flood of comments and advice that you are
getting in your role on the task force. | attach the message to Jon below and | hope that some of the
thoughts are useful and maybe a little comforting for you. With my very warmest regards and best
wishes,

Ted
