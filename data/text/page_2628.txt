confirmed (58), number in
hospital (44), and number in ICU
(>1). Mix of hospital patients is
unknown (from the Singapore data
the ratio of hospitalized to ICU
has ranged from 6:1 to 13:1 from
two data points).

So estimates of severity looking
only at the American passengers:

~400 total American passengers
58 confirmed to have COVID-19

12 Asymptomatic
(20%)

46 Symptomatic (80%)
(44 cases actually hospitalized)

~2% of total
cases requiring ICU admission (1
case)

Expected mortality
for patients with
pneumonia
admitted to ICU
(15-50%);
assuming 2% of
those who become
infected with
COVID-19 require
ICU care, these
mortality rates
equate to a CFR of
0.3%-1.0%
