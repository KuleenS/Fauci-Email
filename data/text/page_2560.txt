Of the 52 new cases, 39 are linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in
Daegu, where the 31st patient, the country's probable "super spreader,"
attended worship services, the KCDC said.

A 61-year-old South Korean woman, who tested positive for the virus
earlier this week, attended worship services at the church on Feb. 9 and
this past Sunday.

KCDC Director Jung Eun-kyeong told reporters Thursday that the
agency is uncertain whether the woman, known as the 31st patient, was
a "super spreader” of the virus but asked 1,001 members of the church
to self-isolate to stem the spread of the virus.

The government decided to designate Daegu and neighboring Cheongdo
as "special management zones," following the spike in the number of
infected people and the nation's first death from the virus.
