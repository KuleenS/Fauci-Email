Good afternoon Sir,

Thank you for your continued vigilance in protecting the Amencan people. Your
wise guidance regarding a temporary national lockdown may greatly help in
reducing the spread of COVID-19.

If this action were to occur it should be in phases:

Phase |: Federal Quarantine. Effective Immediately until 4 MAY 2020 (or further
notice) - ONLY Key and Essential federal employees of all agencies (IC included)
should report to work. Everyone else ts on administrative leave. While buildings are
empty, staff remaining should conduct deep cleaning (air systems, etc.) to ensure a
healthy environment when employees come back to work.

Phase 2: Federal recall: Beginning 4 MAY 2020, federal employees are called back
to work on an as-needed basis (indefinitely) depending on how the virus

trends. Excluding postal workers, that accounts for nearly 2 million full-time
employees. There should be a mandatory home-quarantine so people are not out
spreading the disease.

Phase 3: Mitigation and recovery. Federal agencies need to produce mitigation
measures (crisis action plans) should something of this nature occur in the

future. Fedcral agencies must be ready to respond in an organized manner when a
crisis Occurs.

Throughout this COVID-19 event, military and law enforcement must have an
increased presence to prevent mass hysteria and mob mentality. Increased military
and law enforcement presence may help enforce the home quarantine measures and
prevent looting and other crimes that tend to occur during crisis events.
