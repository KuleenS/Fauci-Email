Dear Tony:

This is a quick note to say Fred and | have been watching you every day, in awe, for weeks now. We
could not be more grateful for your leadership, wisdom, courage, and integrity. Our country could not
be more fortunate that you are still there in guiding us through this terrible time. Needless to say, many
memories of our years working together have been in the forefront of our minds.

Ona personal note {b) (6

My epidemic battling skills are rusty, but if there is anything | can do to help in any way, please know |
are here for you. Fred is as well.
