Tony,

First of all, thank you for getting back to me, in spite of the fact that you are so busy.
Secondly, it’s nice to know they’re not muzzled, since you are so incredibly good at making science speak so easy to
understand for dummies like me.

Once the dust settles, I'd live to see you, to pay attention to our long friendship. Meanwhile, best of luck.
Bob

VP's people to speak publicly about coronavirus. Ever since | have been doing this since the Reagan
administration, whenever a member of the Executive Branch such as me gets invited and goes on National TV such
as the Sunday Talk shows, there is always a routine process of clearing it with your department (in this case HHS)
who then clears it with the White House. This is routine and has been true for the Reagan, Bush '41, Clinton,
Bush'43, Obama, and now the Trump administration. It is merely a formality so that they know what is coming out
from the executive branch. I have always gotten clearance with very few exceptions over the past 35 years (usually
becausc they do not want you on TV at the same time that the President is making an important announcement). |
have never been muzzled or told that I could not speak out publicly about anything during this administration.
