Dr. Fauci:

This is Anthony Foxx, immediate former US Transportation Secretary, and I greatly enjoyed our interactions (brief
thoughts they were) during my time in the last Administration.

I write to request your help in advising the :ransportation community about how to manage through the present
crisis, particularly as some areas are easing restrictions. I would welcome an opportunity to join you in a Q/A, which
could be valuable for rideshare companies{____ AO) 00), transit agencies, airlines etc. 1 would
think that a 10-15 minute chat would do wonders. That said, I know you are terribly busy and have so many things
to do but would appreciate any opportunity to help you get important information out.

This could be pulled together rapidly and done within the next week or so.
Thanks for your attention to this matter. Ali my best,

Anthony.
