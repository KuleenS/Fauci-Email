Subject: COVID 19: Possible main cause of fatalities, it could be not respiratory

 

Good morning Dr Fauci,

| ve been following you on COVID briefings from the White House every night. | trust your experience,
professionality and above all your wisdom in these weeks.

While | am a mechanical engineer and | run my food company fro living, | have been interested and
passionate to the global fight to the Coronavirus.

SUGGESTION: Could it be possible that people die of pulmonary micro thrombosis rather than
respiratory issues? If this is the case, this is more a cardiovascular issue than a respiratory, and
ventilation or intubation do not count as much as, instead, to give patients some drugs to prevent the
thrombosis, such as ANTI-INFIAMMATORIES. If you ventilate a lung where blood doesn’t get there, may
be it’s useless! In fact 9 out of 10 die. If the problem were cardiovascular and not respiratory, then it
could be a venous microthrombosis and not pneumonia that determines fatality. And why are thrombi
formed? Because there is an inflammation that induces thrombosis through a complex but well-known
pathophysiological mechanisms.

| know this thesis is right the contrary of some recommendations that several doctors all over the world
(in China first) had made so far: no ibuprofene, no anthibiotics etc etc.

But | believe that some researches on the cardiovascular problem induced by inflammation would be
worth doing it.

An apology for my English.
Thank you for your attention,

Stay healthy!
Kindest regards

Nicola
