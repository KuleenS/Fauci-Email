Dear Dr.Fauci ,

| would like to congratulate you for your excellent work and thank you for leading us in

the fight against COVID-19 pandemic.

We are 14 critical care physicians and almost 30 hospitalist physicians at Memorial medical
center and HSHS St. John medical center in Springfield Illinois and are the frontline workers

in dealing with the situation.

We are developing protocols and creating safety net for the hospitals and community with

the help of your guidance.

| would like to bring up an issue plaguing us with concern for years and now even more So.

It concerns us and more importantly our helpless families. It might be untimely to bring up

this issue but it is very important for us and our families.

Ce) During this pandemic, it’s important that

physicians can help other areasin the country in need.
Immigrant work force on Work Visa (H-1 visa) constitutes at least 50% of physicians.

 

CF Your assistance in bringing up these issues with the pr

will help us work with reassurance from government
and help our community with peace of mind.
