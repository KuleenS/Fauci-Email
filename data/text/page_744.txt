Hi Tony,

Thanks! Hope you are doing well.

This is basically exactly what we are working to facilitate with our RADx and digital health (app) platform
initiatives...greatly expanding testing and creating a digital backbone to provide people with ways to
access tests and interpret results. For expanding testing platforms, see https://www.nibib.nih.gov/news-
events/newsroom/nih-mobilizes-national-innovation-initiative-covid-19-diagnostics We have >700
applications that have been started in just a few days. For the digital health (e.g. app) platform we’ve
put a lot of thought into the design and are hoping a contractor will be able to launch a pilot study of
healthcare workers soon. Ned and | plan on issuing additional calls in this area with multiple institutes
as stakeholders in the coming weeks.

Best,

Bruce
