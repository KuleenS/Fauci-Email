Please pass greetings to Dr Fauci

His authorship on Google Scholar including of Harrison's has been under discussion on social media

Lucio has been writing the chapter on hemolytic anemia

He is heading to Italy for 3 months. He has been incredible. He was leaving his copies with the Sickle cell
programme as we plan on getting keen scientists to read them

Stay safe

Prof Julie Makani, T:+{____ (8) 6) E: jmakani@blood.ac.tz
