Tony,

| haven’t wanted to bother you, but wanted to say thanks for all you are doing, and hope you are at least
to a small extent finding a way to take care of yourself.

PYOis hard at work at [@) Jon a couple of coronavirus projects, so we’re counting on him.

Of course any time you want to write something, our page is available.

Warmly,

Fred
