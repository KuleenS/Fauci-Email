argument to abandon “America First” posturing and to recognize that our
own fate is closely tied to the fate of other nations.

Much about the future course of the disease depends on the answer to
a scientific question: Is someone who has the virus but lacks symptoms -— or
has symptoms so mild they hardly notice — capable of transmitting the
virus to others? “It looks like the answer is yes,” says Fauci. Which would
make the virus far harder to control.

“We may find that the virus is highly transmissible, but less lethal
than we thought in the beginning,” Fauci told me. In this case, the danger
would be similar to a particularly bad influenza. And the outbreaks could be
seasonal, like the flu as well. “I would not be surprised if that happened,”
Fauci concluded.
