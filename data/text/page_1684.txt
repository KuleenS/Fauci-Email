Emilio:

Thanks for your note. As | had mentioned to Bill yesterday evening, |am enthusiastic about
moving towards a collaborative and hopefully synergistic approach to COVID-19 on the part of
NIAID/NIH, BARDA and the BMGF. | will ask John Mascola and Emily Erbelding to connect with
you to stay a conversation. Perhaps they can organize a call with you including BARDA. | will
try to engage as much as! can given my current circumstances. We look forward to working
with you.

Best regards,
Tony

Subject: Connection Request per Bill Gates

Tony—|! received a note from Trevor and Bill that they connected with you yesterday and they asked me
to reach out. I’ve taken on the role of coordinating the foundation’s contributions to the global COVID
vaccine efforts, in particular for those approaches that are (or soon will be} in early development.
There’s an obvious need for coordination among the various primary funders or the focus we need to
have given the state of the pandemic will become lost through uncoordinated activities.

Bill tells me that you will take on a central role in coordinating BARDA’s funding to the ongoing efforts.
And, of course, there are the NIH/VRC activities. I’m reaching out to ask how we can coordinate and
cross-inform each other’s activities. | am very sensitive to how busy you are and very grateful for your
engagement. | see you on TV almost every day, and although you continue to have considerable energy,
|am seriously worried about you. The nation and the world absolutely need your leadership.

As a next step we can connect 1:1 briefly or you can pass this on to an appropriate member of your
staff.

 

If you wish, you can always reach out to me directly at any time though my personal mobile at{__®) ©

Please stay well....Emilio
