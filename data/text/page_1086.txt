Hi Henry and Alice,

lam not sure how we want to handle interview requests like this.
Would someone on the Panel want to/be allowed to speak to the press
about the guidelines?

lam happy to politely decline if we want to handle it that way.

It is nice to see that we are being picked up by the press already
though. | am glad people are already expressing interest.

Just let me know!
Claire
