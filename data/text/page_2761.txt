Subject: Business Council - Invitation to speak at the February
20-21, 2020 meeting at the Ritz Carlton (22nd and M St. NW),
Washington, D.C.

Dear Dr. Fauci,

On behalf of our co-chairs for the winter meeting of The
Business Council, David Rubenstein of The Carlyle Group and
Ginni Rometty of IBM, we would like to formally invite you to
participate in our meeting on February 20-21, 2020 in
Washington, D.C. The theme of the meeting is “The Next
Decade.” (See formal invitation attached as well as list of CEO
members).

We would like for you to participate in a 50 minute fireside chat
with David Rubenstein (and possibly Dr. Francis Collins) to
discuss the current coronavirus as well as what we should
expect in the next decade. We want to give our CEOs insights
into what the next 10 years will bring in terms of detection,
diagnosis and treatment of diseases. All conversations are
strictly off the record and closed press. We will cover all lodging
and transportation.

As you know, The Business Council is comprised of the chief
executive officers of the largest global corporations,
representing all segments of the economy. We expect at least
150 CEO members, spouses and speakers to be in attendance.
