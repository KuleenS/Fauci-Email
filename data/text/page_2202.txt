Dear Dr. Fauci:

| work for Focus Pointe Global, a Schlesinger Group Clinical Research Company that has a
data base of over 6 million participants globally. Our company is the largest of its kind in
the world. | wanted to reach out to the NIH &NIAID to see if there is any way our company
can be of help during the coronavirus epidemic.

We have the unique ability to survey this panel of participants online or in person, asking
various questions getting data back fairly quickly (approximately 2 weeks). Our company
utilizes industry leading techniques and can follow this group for years in the future. We

have worked with the NIH, CDC &such institutions as Northwestern University, Stanford,
Harvard, Battelle, NORC, ICF etc., for many years.

Please contact me if this is of interest and our company can be of help.
Kind Regards,
Kay Savio
