humans in Hunan province (which neighbors Hubei/Wuhan area).

I also have lots of information about USA.
Here is some:

I believe that many COVID-19 deaths were incorrectly labelled at
2019-2020 flu deaths. The spreading in the USA is almost
certainly already homogeneous, because it's been going on since
last year without any containment whatsoever. Once massive
testing finally starts, this truth/reality will, unfortunately, become
obvious. It will manifest itself as hyper exponential (hyperbolic)
growth starting a day or two after the millions of testing kits
arrive and start being used. The hyper exponential dynamics will
eventually evolve to a more accurately calibrated exponential
curve once the number to tests is large enough to properly
sample the population. I don't think Italy is ahead of us. I think
we're ahead and by a large amount.

A few other quick bits of info...

The time between infection and death seems to have decreased
from about ~20 days (a few months) ago to possibly as short as
~8 days. And, the incubation period seems to be significantly
longer. Both, and other data I've looked at, strongly suggest at
least one mutation has occurred. This is extremely concerning to
me. Another concern is the distribution of deaths vs. age appears
to not be as strongly biased, compared to when China data was
included, towards older people and/or people with chronic health
conditions.

Over the past 15+ years, I've traveled to China multiple times
per year. I'm pretty sure you've known this for a while, but I
truly believe the outbreak tsunmai in the USA is either already
happened or is about to happen. As you know, as soon as a
surge is sensed, the Tsunami will immediately follow. I believe
we missed the containment boat quite a while ago. I've been
