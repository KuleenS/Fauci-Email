Tony,

| expect you know Dr. Richard Tubb. He and | worked closely together in the White House 18 years ago. |
have a lot of confidence in his judgment, and therefore am forwarding the materials he sent me for your
consideration.

| know nothing about the technologies involved, but | know this is a time to write off no good options.

Warm regards,

NIH-001378
