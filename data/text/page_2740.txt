ABOUT FIRING LINE WITH MARGARET HOOVER

Firing Line with Margaret Hoover is a refreshing reprisal of William F. Buckley’s iconic PBS
program, a smart, civil and engaging contest of ideas. The series maintains the character of the
original, providing a platform that is diligent in its commitment to civility and the rigorous
exchange of opinion. Firing Line with Margaret Hoover comes at a time when meaningful
discourse is needed more than ever. Interviews and debates will highlight leading lights from
the left and right, complemented by archival footage from the original Firing Line to remind
viewers of longstanding conservative and liberal arguments, where they've been disproved or
reinforced over time. It is an opportunity to engage in the debate about the America that we
want to create for the 21st century — and summon Americans of every political persuasion to a
rigorous examination of the choices we must make together in the challenging years ahead.
Showrunner is Emmy, Dupont and Murrow-winning producer Alyssa Litoff.
