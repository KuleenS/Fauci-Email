6. Predominant Role of Bacterial Pheumonia as a Cause of Death in Pandemic Influenza:
Implications for Pandemic Influenza Preparedness

How can this happen? How can the doctors be so blind. I have a theory
about this and here it comes:

My was a psychologist. May she rest in peace in heaven.

It seems that the corona virus has affected the brain more in a certain group
in society, namely politicians, doctors, journalists and other with power and
positions in the society. The virus is not dangerous for this group, but it's
opens a door in the brain's cell wall that allows it to enter the fear center of
the brain.

This door has been closed for many years. We haven't had any major wars
and nothing has threatened them. They have felt invulnerable. Convinced of
their own superior ability and greatness. Not only can they control the
people, they can now control the climate by turning the carbon dioxide tap.
If they close it, the temperature drops, if they open it the temperature goes
up. They don't know that the sun is 109 times as big as our planet. 109
times. It seams so small when we look up in the sky. They thought they
could control everything.

Then came the VIRUS, they receive an abrupt awakening. They get
scared. Politicans get sick and die. Doctors die. The brain is attacked by fear
virus. They can no longer think clearly and logically. The panic is near, they
are reminded of their own mortality. Just like a virus in a computer. It's
slows it down and it becomes unusable. Thats whats happen when a fear
virus attacks the brain.

Here where I live, there are panic over 1600 confirmed cases. The televison
is talking "infected persons" when there is "confirmed laboratory cases". It's
two different things. Misleading the people. Why panic over 1 600 infected?
Closing all not nessecary buissness, all schools, all except for supermarket,
gas station, banks. You can't go out after 5.00 pm. If you do, you get
arrested.
