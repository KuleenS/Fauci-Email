Thanks for the note. Sorry that I had to cancel. This is White House in full overdrive and I am in the middle of
it. Reminiscent of post-anthrax days. 1 will send an email to Jake today to introduce you. Again, sorry about the
cancellation. Hope to see yousoon. Regards to Jason.

Best,
Tony

Hey tony

Know you are buried in coronavirus. Totally understand need to cancel meeting tomorrow. We will set up a zoom
in hen things calm down.

We have made additional progress on hbv including data from 2 new mouse models. We were going to share
Monday

Realize this is last minute but might it be possible for you to connect me to jake liang in case we can squeeze in a
meeting with him (serhat is already on east coast - we took a risk knowing you might have to cancel)?

If you are not comfortable with that | could send him a cold call email mentioning we have shared the data with

you. You were kind enough to introduce us at the nam dinner when{ OY 6.

Hope you at least have time to enjoy Super Bowl. Hang in there - am sure everyone is leaning heavily on you as
usual.

Thanks much

Mark
