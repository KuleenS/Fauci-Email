Good afternoon Dr Fauci,

We are interested in seeing if you would be available for a chat via Zoom to New
Zealand about COVID-19

The US is an essential part of the NZ economy contributing between $1.5 and $2
billion dollars annually from tourism alone and we would love to have a
conversation about where the US is at, how COVID-19 is being dealt with, and the
future of things that could lead up to opening our borders again.

We're happy to have you for any length of time, but if you have 10-20 minutes that
would be amazing.

Thank you for what you are doing in this global event, I hope we can connect
sometime soon

Sincerely,

Pat Brittenden
