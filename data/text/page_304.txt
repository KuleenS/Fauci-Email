Subject: NEJM content proof (Fauci)

Importance: High

Dear Dr Fauci,

Attached is the content proof of your editorial. Please read *ALL* of the following instructions and
information carefully before you begin reviewing your proofs.

First, please stop and take a moment now to confirm receipt, so that we can be assured that your
proofs did not end up in a spam folder.

Your editorial has been edited for grammar, consistency, readability, adherence to Journal style, and
clarity for nonspecialist readers. To expedite publication, we do not ask authors for specific approval of
routine changes; please read the entire article to make sure your meaning has been retained. Note that
we may be unable to make changes that conflict with Journal style or create grammatical or other
problems. Finally, please note that a delayed or incomplete response may delay publication of your
editorial.

Please read the entire proof carefully, including all queries. Please return your query replies and proof
corrections **before 12pm (US Eastern) this Friday, February 28, 2020**.

Instructions are provided below. Note that you will be reading for content only; the article will be
rendered for print after the content has been finalized.

The Journal’s senior medical editors will be reading your article at this stage. If they have any additional
comments or queries for you, | will forward them to you in the next few days.

TO ANSWER THE QUERIES: The proof contains in-line numbered query markers and a numbered list of
queries at the end. The query markers and the queries are linked, so you can jump back and forth within
the file. Please respond to all the queries (see below for instructions; please do **NOT** use e-
annotation tools) and convey any additional changes as needed.

TO RESPOND BY E-MAIL: If your corrections and your responses to the queries are straightforward, we
encourage you to respond by replying to this message. Please copy and paste the list of queries into an
e-mail message or a Word document and type your responses there. You may also include a list of
changes (e.g., page 1, line 20, change xxx to yyy). Again, please do **NOT** use e-annotation tools in
the PDF file; the marks are small and easy to miss, which may lead to errors in your article.

Please note that this material is confidential and embargoed until publication. If you have questions
about our embargo policy, please contact NEJM Media Relations at 781-434-7847 or at

Mediasupport@nejm.org.

Again, please do confirm receipt at this time. Thank you very much for your efforts with these content
proofs!
