Dear Dr. Fauci,

Thank you for being willing to step up publicly and have your life overtaken by the coronavirus.
This can’t be easy and is likely to be harder in the coming weeks and months.

Know that we appreciate it and that | am willing to do whatever needs doing to help.

Sincerely,
Madelon Halula
