Hi Tony:

| hope you are well. | want to applaud you and thank you for your incredible leadership in
communicating about this pandemic. | wish CDC were standing with you but | know that is not likely to
happen. | hope that you will continue to talk about all that is being done to learn what works to mitigate
the impact of the pandemic. Your absence these two days has been quite noticeable. If there is anything
| can do to support you, please let me know.

Best regards,

Rich
