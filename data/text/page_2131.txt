Subject: Leading Through A Time of Crisis In Healthcare" - ZRG Thought
Leadership

Hi Dr. Fauci -

| am reaching out as you have been doing an incredible job as part of the White
House Coronavirus Task Force. These are difficult times and you seem to provide
the most informative interviews without sending signals of panic to the American
public.

Not sure if you remember, but we were in touch years back through many executive
clinical leadership searches | conducted during my 18 years at Korn Ferry. | am
now leading the hospital/nealth system practice for ZRG. ZRG is an innovative
global boutique firm disrupting the traditional executive search industry.

As a result of the COVID-19 crisis, | am speaking with/interviewing many healthcare
leaders (Chief Medical Officers, Hospital CEOs, Leading Scientists, etc.) as part of
a thought leadership piece.

The topic is “Leading Through a Time of Crisis in Healthcare”. | know you are
extremely busy with the task force, but | would very much appreciate if you have
some time for an interview/call.

As you know, strong leadership is crucial in times of crisis and we are facing
weeks/months of extremely important decisions by our healthcare leaders
nationwide.

Do you have any availability over the next few weeks to connect? | will make myself
available to meet and/or have a video or phone call at your convenience.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Regards,

Greg
