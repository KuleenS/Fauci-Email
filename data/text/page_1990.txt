All of the therapy stuff is anecdotal. We are trying to get randomized clinical trials done

instead of just compassionate use for all of these unproven drugs.

Fascinating - thanks for sharing with me. The question that | have is whether COVID 19 adheres
and infects epithelial cells through the same mechanism as SARS did. Why the increased
lethality and how to we decrease likelihood of infection?

Just saw today that antiretroviral therapy and malaria agents are being touted as potential
therapies - how well founded is this - anything more than anecdotal data to support this?

Hope you are getting a few moments of rest. [0 6) and do not hesitate to
call me if | can help.

Best,
Ken
