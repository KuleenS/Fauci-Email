Dear Dr. Fauci,

I’m sorry to bother you on a Sunday, but with the first coronavirus death of a U.S. patient
in Washington state, we are wondering if you would be available for a live interview
tomorrow morning our show.

We would like to talk to you about the significance of the death in Washington and what
states can/must do to prevent a widespread outbreak.

Kind regards,
HJ
