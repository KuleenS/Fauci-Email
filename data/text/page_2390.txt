Tony, that part of the message was not directed at you. Peter Staley and | have seen you in action on TV
and I’ve forced Fo) 8} to watch you talking about social distancing, since she
says the President says she has nothing to worry about. Bob Redfield and Secretary Azar haven’t been as
forthright as you have.

The main thing that concerns many people I know: the roll-out of testing, surveillance has been botched
and we’re likely to have cases of COVID in our communities already without knowing it. Meanwhile
some corporations, some universities, some other institutions have started to put social distancing into
place, with a few municipalities doing the same, but there is no real guidance from CDC on when to act
for most of us. There are plenty of instructions about getting prepared, but all seem to point towards
waiting until there is an outbreak in one’s community to do anything substantial, which seems if you’||
excuse my language, ass-backwards, as one you see multiple cases, you’re likely to already have
widespread community transmission.

| think this piece by Bill Hanage at Harvard explains where a lot of us are right now:

Stay well, we need you more than ever (and | mean that from the bottom of my heart). Most of the

career civil servants on the email were copied not to chastise, it’s the political appointees that most
think got us into this mess.
