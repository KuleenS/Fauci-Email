Dear Francis

As you may know, the National Symphony Orchestra has long had an Asia your on its schedule for March
this year, leaving in just two weeks or so. The China portion of the tour was cancelled a few weeks ago
but the Japan portion of the trip has been sustained. Now, with increased focus on Japan, some of the
members and our management are looking for additional advice on travel concerns and any infectious
disease warning/direction. Would you have someone amongst your brilliant colleagues who could be a
resource to our team?

| have included Gary Ginstling on this email as he is our Executive Director of the NSO. Thank you so
much for any direction you can offer us!

Deborah
