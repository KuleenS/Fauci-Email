Thanks for your hard work on Coronavirus. What we desperately need are specific metrics
(available daily to everyone) on the disease. We also need to know how to evaluate

them. When will we know if it is getting better? It is really as bad as the media would have
us believe? Please set some goals and objectives on the metrics so we know where we are
and know when we have won or lost.

Yesterday Rush Limbaugh compared this to data on the Swine Flu in 2009 (60 million cases,
275,000 hospitalizations, 12,500 deaths from your website) and suddenly the Corona virus
doesn’t sound very bad at all. Yet we have shut down the world economy and done
irreparable harm to many lives. Can you explain this? Frankly no one even remembers the
Swine Flu epidemic only 10 years ago.
