Hi Dr. Fauci: I saw that you spoke about the lack of major
drugmakers stepping up to make coronavirus vaccine, and my
colleague James Paton is working on a story about that issue.
James's story has to do with a biosecurity initiative related to
these types of threats at GSK that was started in 2016 and quickly
put on the back burner. I don't know whether you'd want to comment
on the company or its activities itself, but would be helpful if
you could talk about the importance of getting big drugmakers
involved in helping to fill the need for new vaccines. I'm in
Geneva right now at the WHO coronavirus science forum, but hope we
can talk for a minute or two. Best way to reach me is via Whatsapp,
where my number is [("@@). Please let me know if/when
you're free. Thanks and regards, JL
