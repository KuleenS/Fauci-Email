Dear Dr. Fauci,

| host the AMDG Jesuit Podcast, which reaches a faith-based audience connected to Jesuit
institutions around the country. | would love to welcome you onto the show to discuss the
coronavirus and how your Jesuit education has shaped your career. It would be great to
have 15-20 minutes of your time. Thanks very much for your consideration.

Best,
Mike
