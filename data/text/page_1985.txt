Subject: COVID-19 science brainstorm at NIH, and town meeting

 

Hi Tony,

Nice Facebook session with Zuck! And | heard you were just on CNN, but | missed that one. | did an
interview with Sheila Kaplan late this afternoon — and she greatly appreciated your message of apology.

When we spoke yesterday, you were enthusiastic about the convening of a 2 — 3 hour session of IC
Directors and SMEs from their ICs, to brainstorm about additional scientific efforts that could be
mounted at NIH to address COVID-19. It looks as if this can be arranged for an early afternoon next
week. Obviously there would be nothing better than to have you there in person for this. While | know

We have the NIH virtual Town Meeting at 1 PM tomorrow. Is there any chance you can come to Wilson
Hall in person for that? If not, is there a chance you can call in? | will serve as moderator, and after a
few minutes of opening remarks, would hope to turn this over to you for ten minutes or so of the
unique Fauci perspective. After that, Larry and Alfred will talk for a few minutes about the NIH COVID
Response Team, and Jim Gilman will talk about what’s happening at the CC. Then we'll open it up to
questions, which we can accept in real time from the estimated 20,000 staff who will be logged in. But
you wouldn’t need to stay for all that — if we could somehow have your participation (either in person or
on the phone) from about 1:10 to 1:20, that would be really wonderful. Please let me know if that will
be possible.

 

Sorry about the long e-mail. Get some sleep!

Best, Francis
