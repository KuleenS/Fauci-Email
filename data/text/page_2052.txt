Subject: Question about COVID-19 Mechanism of Transmission
Hi Tony:

Thank you for what you are doing for our country to try and limit the consequences of COVID-19. Many
Americans are hanging on your every word, as they should be, and that includes me.

A question about COVID-19 mechanism of spread: The reported reproductive number from China of
about 2.6 indicates a likelihood of large droplet spread as the mode of transmission from person to
person. My question is - could there be a component of airborne spread (droplet nuclei) with this virus?
If super spreaders exist with COVID-19, is airborne spread possible? Knowing the answer to this question
would help to inform decisions about PPE and Decontamination in settings such as Emergency
Departments. If this is not already known definitively, could NIOSH and some key partners possibly study
it in current quarantine settings?

Thanks, Tony. God bless you and your important work!

Best, Ed
