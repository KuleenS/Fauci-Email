information on the Americans
(hospital data in Japan including
number acutely ill, number
needing ICU admission, and
number only in the hospital for
isolation). Would also be critical
to gather/compile the same
information from Canada, South
Korea, Italy, Hong Kong, and
other nations as they also evacuate
their citizens. The cruise ship is a
circumscribed population where it
is possible to get a handle on
severity fairly early in an
epidemic. The limitation though,
is the population on board that
ship is elderly (so need to be
careful about generalizing to the
entire population). But it 1s the
best data we have.

The reason why this 1s so
important is decisions re the
implementation of NPIs depend
upon severity (the more severe the
more intense the NPIs). The
sooner we have a more accurate
assessment of severity, the better
for making plans for NPIs.
