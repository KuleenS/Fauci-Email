Subject: Potential PHS Officer Deployment

Tony & Hugh, in follow up, the PHS has informed all PHS officers that as of 2/3
they are subject to deployment for coronavirus work “without supervisory
approval”, meaning that if needed, officers can be deployed and assigned
anywhere, for indefinite periods, by the Assistant Secretary of Health.

We are hearing that many officers, especially physicians and nurses, may be
deployed for quarantine efforts and to assist State agencies.

| haven’t heard anything personally, but just want to let you know. These
deployment orders can come with almost no advance warning, although | don’t
expect that.
