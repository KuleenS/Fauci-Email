Dear Ms. Angel:

The severe complication of coronavirus are heavily skewed towards the elderly and those
with underlying conditions (Heart disease, Chronic lung disease, kidney disease, diabetes,
etc.) Most of the pneumonias are pure viral pneumonia and so this vaccination will not help
that. However, on the chance that you have a pure viral pneumonia that gets secondarily
complicated by a bacterial pneumonia (pneumococcal) the vaccine would be beneficial. If
you are 65 years of age or older, you should get the pneumonvax23 vaccine anyway
regardless of the risk of coronavirus infection.

Thanks,
Tony
