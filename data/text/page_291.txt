e Gene-RADAR platform for Real time Mobile (POC) Coronavirus detection/ viral load
monitoring

© Highly sensitive and specific — minimize false positives and false negatives

© With very good LOD’s we could potentially start to catch people
presymptomatically and enable the early detection , early quarantine
would limit the spread and early intervention could lead to better
outcomes

© More precise viral load monitoring could help determine when to release
people from quarantine or ICU beds

© Our platform’s ability to quantify vial loads could change clinical trial
endpoints for new drug candidates or (repurposed drug formulations),
thereby accelerating FDA approvals for novel therapeutic regimen

© We already have an ISO 13485 certified manufacturing facility (currently in
Boston) that we are prepared to move as fast as possible to ramp up our
production
We would love to work with you to repurpose our FDA approved platform
for the above coronavirus applications assay and help your noble efforts
to stop this outbreak from becoming a full blown global pandemic that
could costs thousands of lives and cause trillions of dollars of economic
damage to the global economy.

We would love to speak with you to brief on our capabilities and discuss how we can
qualify for some of the emergency funding being made available to help tackle this
pandemic threat.

Happy to jump on a phone call to discuss further how we can help
