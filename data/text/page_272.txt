You are correct about the Israeli vaccine. | cannot imagine that they would have a safe and
effective vaccine deployable in 90 days.

Hi Tony and Larry,

See below for a new Health Care Resilience Task Force being convened by ASPR.

The initial meeting overlaps with our House approps hearing.

Tony, who shall we send to this one?

P.S. to Tony — I’m getting a lot of buzz about the Israeli claim to have fast track vaccine:
2020/02/israel-to-have-coronavirus-vaccine-within-3-weeks/ It looks to me
that they are conflating having something ready to put into volunteers for a phase 1 trial, and

having full scale production ready to go for the global needs. That still seems like it’s a year
away. Am | right?
