Yesterday, Australians who were cleared to finally disembark the
Diamond Princess were driven by bus to Haneda Airport for the
chartered flight home.

They first needed to pass a health check to receive an approval of
disembarkation notice by Japanese quarantine officials.

They were then screened several more times before they could board
the Qantas 747.

On the plane, they had no contact with Qantas crew, who remained
upstairs for the flight. Food for passengers was already waiting for them
at their seats when they boarded.

If they passed the latest health check, they would have been given
“approval of disembarkation” notices by Japanese quarantine officials,
which grant them permission to enter Japan.

From Yokohama Port, where the ship was docked, they boarded buses
to Haneda Airport.

Brisbane student Tehya Pfeffer, 18, who has been quarantined on the
Diamond Princess with her grandmother Cathy, was among them.

“At 10.30am (local time, 12.30pm AEDT) we will start to be screened
and given luggage tags and wrist bands,” Ms Pfeffer told news.com.au
yesterday.

“At Spm we have to have our luggage put outside, and at 6pm we will
disembark the ship and go through a makeshift customs. This is where
we use our wrist bands.

‘And then we will take a bus to the airport and at around 12am
Thursday we will fly to Darwin.”

On the evacuation flight, cabin crew would not be making direct contact
with evacuees.

Meals were already waiting for passengers at their seats when they
boarded, and Qantas staff remained upstairs.

All those returning to Australia on the Qantas flight will spend two
weeks in quarantine at the Howard Springs facility, in addition to the
two weeks in lockdown they’ ve had on the ship.
