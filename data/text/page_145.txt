Hi Tony, Mary and Carl:

Every Saturday am, the DHVI team meets in my office to work on moving the HIV vaccine work forward, and now
a new contingent is also working on coronavirus vaccine and new therapeutics.

This picture was from 9 am this Saturday morning. Great and dedicated crew listening to the presentation of data!
Best bart
