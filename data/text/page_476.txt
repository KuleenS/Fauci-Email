Thanks, Tony.

| would love you to consider my request to “tag along” with you some day - not to join you for meetings (I would
wait outside unless invited in) or listen in on conference calls but to chat with you in between to give people an
inside look at how seriously the government is taking the outbreak. And I could bring down a shmear from Bamey
Greengrass tor lunch. How could you pass that up???
