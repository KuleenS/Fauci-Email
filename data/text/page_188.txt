Hi again Tony. Here's a link to a non-technical explanation of the paper I shared with you carlicr:

https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/new-outbreaks-of-coronavirus-can-be-halted-with-isolation-measures-

 

according-to-study

I have seen predictions stating that upwards of 30% of the world's population will be infected, but | don't see this
happening. What I do see are lots of local outbreaks from imported cases, some larger than others, but all heading
towards containment. I find Israel to be an interesting test case. A group of infected Korean tourists who visited the
country only tested positive for coronavirus after their return to Korea, joining the large outbreak that has been
reported there. The itinerary of their travel group has been made public so that retrospectively, Israeli public health
officials could ascertain who was exposed where and when (see
https://www.health.gov.il/English/News_and_Events/Spokespersons_ Messages/Pages/23022020 _l.aspx). Already
1,600 Israelis have been quarantined on account of possible exposure. It has been twelve days since this group of
tourists returned to Korea, and no new infections have been reported in Israel associated with this group (there are
two Israelis who were infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, and one infected while in Italy). See
https://www.ynetnews.con/article/H InXPa7E8. It will be interesting (and important) to see how many new
infections are detected in the days ahead, and if such new infections are found among those already under preventive
watch.

Nonetheless I totally concur with preparing as if major transmission will occur. Much better to err by over- rather
than under- preparing (a familiar perspective from those bygone smallpox debates).

Finally, a reporter asked me yesterday afternoon what I wanted the President to say last night. Here was my
response:

In a sober way summarize the facts of the outbreak, state that the US has an excellent preparedness team between
CDC and NIH, that at the advice of this team travel restrictions and quarantine measures have already been enacted,
but as of now the public is at very low risk of infection. Still, citizens should go to cde.gov now to learn from our
experts how to prepare in the event that more extreme measures are needed, stay abreast of the situation here and
abroad and follow the advice of our experts, get a flu shot (!), and know that the US has a very strong public health
system that can withstand this challenge.

Anyway, just wanted to share all this with you. Keep up the good work and good luck with the vaccine research, Ed
