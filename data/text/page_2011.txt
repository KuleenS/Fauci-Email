The questions you shared with Amanda were really for Dr. Fauci; he’s our spokesperson on all
research specific questions. | know he’s really backed up and NIAID is doing the best they can with his
incredibly packed schedule. The interview with the Atlantic was really intended as a profile, but ended
up covering a lot of COVID questions. We can check in with NIAID to see what we can do.

Thanks,

Renate

Subject: Re: Coronavirus interview with Dr. Collins

Hi there,

Why were we told we could not do an interview, when, after our request, he did one with The
Atlantic. You referred us to Dr. Fauci but he isn't talking, either. This doesn't seem fair to us. Can we
really not speak to either of them for a story this weekend?

Thanks, SK
