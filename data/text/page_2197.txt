biologic vaccines and drugs such as insulin, seasonal flu and
other vaccines and antibodies to make healthcare more
accessible and affordable to patients.

I am confident that a meeting with you can be very productive
in further stimulating big pharma and other research
institutions to speed effective, low cost vaccines and antibodies
to market.

Given the severity of the current coronavirus situation, I am
prepared to make myself available for a meeting at your
convenience.

My cell number is should you want to reach me
quickly.

Sincerely,
