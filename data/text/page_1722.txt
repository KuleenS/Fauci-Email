Subject: Additional data on masks

 

Dr. Fauci,

In addition, | found the attachedd review on masks that addresses use in the community settings.
Attached are the paper and figure 3, which summarizes the data from 9 very diverse RCTs (overlapping
with what | had sent earlier}.

Bottom line: generally there were not differences in ILI/URI/or flu rates when masks were used,
although when early use and compliance was taken into account, a few times a difference was seen.

In addition:

This case control study noted that, among SARS patients in Hong Kong without a known source of
infection, cases (27.9%) were less likely than uninfected controls (58.7%) to report wearing a mask
frequently in public, for what that’s worth.
