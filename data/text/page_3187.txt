Hi Tony,

Thanks for sharing. Yes, | saw this earlier today and both Eddie and myself are actually quoted in it. It’s a
great article, but the problem is that our phylogenetic analyses aren’t able to answer whether the
sequences are unusual at individual residues, except if they are completely off. On a phylogenetic tree
the virus looks totally normal and the close clustering with bats suggest that bats serve as the reservoir.
The unusual features of the virus make up a really small part of the genome (<0.1%) so one has to look
really closely at all the sequences to see that some of the features (potentially) look engineered.

We have a good team lined up to look very critically at this, so we should know much more at the end of
the weekend. | should mention that after discussions earlier today, Eddie, Bob, Mike, and myself all find
the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory. But we have to look at this much
more closely and there are still further analyses to be done, so those opinions could still change.

Best,
Kristian

This just came out today. You may have seen it. If not, it is of interest to the current
