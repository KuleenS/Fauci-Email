Subject: coronavirus vaccine using cow pox-small pox example

hi sir,

currently an effective vaccine for covid-19 appears 12-16 months away. in view of
rampant spread of disease , we can use the cow pox-small pox idea to minimize the
disease mortality.

if general population at large was purposefully infected with human coronavirus
strains which classically cause mild URTI's , the chances of them getting infected or
more probably getting severely ill with covid-19 would be definitely reduced. we do
not need to make a vaccine of these strains - classically they cause mild, self-
limiting URTT's.

we have these resources and can do this in a very short period.

think over it - time to innovate like Edward Jenner did.

regards ,
