Cristina:

This is not just your ordinary person writing tous. This is Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach, former
Director of NCI and Former Commissioner of FDA. | have no idea if this proposal has any merit;
however, please have someone go over it carefully and put together a response. Also, only if
appropriate, and feasible, see if there is any way we can be of assistance to him. Thanks.

Best regards,
Tony
