Wondering whether it has been considered that only the vulnerable population (those over 60 and/or those with
underlying health conditions)be isolated ? Iam a{@)@psychiatrist and after contemplating this option was
wondering if this could still reduce the risk to healthcare Systems with less disruption to our society. I await your
response and appreciate all you are doing. Beth Abramson MD
