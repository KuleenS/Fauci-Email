But if you thought you had coronavirus?

You would be sent to a fever clinic. They would take your temperature, your symptoms, medical history,
ask where you’d traveled, your contact with anyone infected. They’d whip you through a CT scan...
Wait — “whip you through a CT scan”?

Each machine did maybe 200 a day. Five, 10 minutes a scan. Maybe even partial scans. A typical hospital
in the West does one or two an hour. And not X-rays; they could come up normal, but a CT would show
the “ground-glass opacities” they were looking for.

(Dr. Aylward was referring to lung abnormalities seen in coronavirus patients.)

And then?

If you were still a suspect case, you’d get swabbed. But a lot would be told, “You’re not Covid.” People
would come in with colds, flu, runny noses. That’s not Covid. If you look at the symptoms, 90 percent
have fever, 70 percent have dry coughs, 30 percent have malaise, trouble breathing. Runny noses were
only 4 percent.

The swab was for a PCR test, right? How fast could they do that? Until recently, we were sending all of
ours to Atlanta.

They got it down to four hours.

So people weren’t sent home?

No, they had to wait. You don’t want someone wandering around spreading virus.

If they were positive, what happened?

They’d be isolated. In Wuhan, in the beginning, it was 15 days from getting sick to hospitalization. They
got it down to two days from symptoms to isolation. That meant a lot fewer infected — you choke off
this thing’s ability to find susceptibles.

What’s the difference between isolation and hospitalization?
