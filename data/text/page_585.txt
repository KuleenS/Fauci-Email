didn't have a clue but got a little cough still you can you might want to debate left me
and i'm a little to keep but maybe also because of the jet lag in the travels and
everything else on top of it no it doesn't feel any different than you know recuperating
from a regular coal carl's wave jerry hasn't been diagnosed with the virus is she's
being monitored in a different part of the hospital but their case is a good example of
some things we know and some things we don't know about how this virus is
spreading so we have called doctor anthony fauci he's director of the national
institute of allergy and infectious diseases good morning sir good morning so carl
coleman was fine all those days on the ship then he gets on a plane and he gets a
fever what does that tell us about how this virus is spreading well the virus has the
ability to bind it to certain cells in your body particularly in your long so you can get
anything from miles a symptomatic illness to a cough and a fever to some people
about oh about twenty percent of the people come to the attention of medical than
physicians in health care providers can get serious pneumonias requiring intensive
care it sounds like this individual is on the %hesitation mild side of the illness
because as he said it doesn't feel much more than just a common cold and as a
matter of fact corona viruses in general prior to this all one of the causes of the
common cold okay so what does that tell us i mean bleary often looking at the cases
we're looking at a rising death toll which is tragic we look much less at the people like
carly say you know my voice is raspy a had a fever had a cough the years a wide
range of stuff symptoms with this virus did do do we know why some people seem to
be doing okay and other people are getting hit really hard well whether a couple
things about that for the first thing is that any any kind of viral infection or any
pathogen infection there's always a wide range of responses in the sense almost like
a bill shaped curve some people get no sim is at all and we do have a symptomatic
corona virus infection with this particular episode and then there's the bulk of people
who get some sort of symptoms and then a small percentage of people do really
really very poorly now that relates to the ability of the body to handle the virus and
the one thing we know when it's not unique to this virus is that the elderly those with
underlying conditions like chronic heart disease lung disease diabetes obesity they
tend to get more complications much more than for example and otherwise healthy
individual and that's the reason why if you look at the death rate which is around two
percent for this disease at this time it is disproportionately high are among the elderly
and particularly those who have underlying conditions this is interesting question
carlin is wave terry presumably they work together the entire time they were
quarantined right and if he gets the virus she does not did she just get lucky do some
people have some sort of immune undefended don't it's a combination that's a good
question it's a combination of both there is no virus that has one hundred percent
attack rate even the most of infectious of all viruses like measles doesn't get a
hundred percent of of “hesitation vulnerable people but respiratory viruses
particularly things like influenza or the corona virus the attack rate is burying
percentage and it was if he was really likely that his wife i don't think she necessarily
had any on the line immune protection though that's possible the maybe some cross
reaction of immune protection with other %hesitation microbes that she came into
contact with but in most likely is as you suggest the luck of the draw okay interesting
