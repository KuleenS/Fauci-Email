Dr. Fauci - Who can | speak with about the status of the test kits? | am also concerned about reports
from CDC that there are six states, including Wyoming, with no certified lab in which to conduct tests.

Thank you,
Liz Cheney

Thank you for your note. | would have been very happy to provide remarks at the weekly
meeting of the Republican Conference. However, | have a late afternoon and panel

Congressional Hearing with Secretary Azar followed by a meeting with the President in the
Roosevelt Room of the White House, which overlaps with the time frame of your meeting
tomorrow. | would be most happy to do this at another time. If you could have your office
contact my Special Assistant, Patty Conrad (copied here), she will help arrange setting up
something at a mutually convenient time.
