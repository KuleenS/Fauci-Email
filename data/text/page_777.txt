Subject: Validated precise prediction of remdesivir's clinical efficacy on SARS-CoV-2 viral load

Dear Dr. Fauci,

I'd like to share with you that the recent clinical trial results on remdesivir have validated our
prediction of the remdesivir-specific post-treatment viral rebound in human COVID-19 patients.
More details can be found in our official announcement https://bit.ly/RRemdesivir.

This prediction of remdesivir's clinical efficacy on viral load made on Feb. 23 2020]
