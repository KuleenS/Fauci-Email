Subject: Covid-19 comments on UK response

Dear Dr Fauci

| was just re-reading your January 23 Viewpoint article in JAMA. So little time has passed,
but so much has changed, and your comments seem prescient.

| have been working on emergent/re-emergent infectious agents for some time, and
authored a 2018 report for the UK government on vaccine responses that was summarised
in a Vaccine publication last October attached. As almost everyone else, my attention has
been redirected to Covid-19, although monkeypox remains a focus of my interest.

You and your colleagues may be interested in two short documents | produced for the UK
government on the 20°" and 22" of March. That also seems long ago now!

As fellow citizen of our planet, | thank you and colleagues for your unstinting efforts to
control infectious disease and Covid-19 in particular.

Warmest wishes

Karl
