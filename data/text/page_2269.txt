Subject: News - Germ/Virus Containment
Importance: High

Hi Dr. Fauci,

| have been following the news and some interviews with yourself. | was hoping you would be willing to
speak with me about our technology?

Testing for the positive patients and finding a vaccine are essential, but containment is paramount.

We have the only GERM CONTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY of it's kind.

The ongoing Coronavirus and FLU viruses pose a significant threat to public health globally and here in
the US.

We have the most powerful solution to minimize infection and maximize protection against SARS,
EBOLA, FLU, and all types of germs and viruses.

With local 3rd party tested efficacy of 100%, no other technology anywhere can yield this result or
sustainable 24/7/365 protection.

XTIO2 is a world exclusive containmen: technology with self-cleaning functions that can help minimize the
risk of cross-contamination in hospitals, planes, public transportation, elevators, and public places.

XT!O2 technology works by forming an invisible protective layer on mostly ALL material surfaces (plastic,

steel, glass, fabric, paper, walls, etc...). It is green, sustainable, and has yielded up to 100% efficacy
proven by SGS LABS (US).
