Tony:

lam loath to contact you given that | am sure you are overwhelmed. However, we are now being
contacted by sources at tertiary academic hospitals with CLIA-high complexity clinical labs who are
alarmed about their inability to scale up SARS-CoV2 qRT-PCR testing in their facilities in the time frame
they feel is neccesary, even after Saturday's FDA regulatory guidance and the availability of Integrated
DNA Technology's testing reagents. (An example of such an email is below.) | am passing this along with
the hopes that if you can do something about it, you will. From an email:

“We have experience bringing up laboratory developed tests. We have never submitted an
EUA before. For our current LDTs, they are typically for pathogens that we have some
experience with, positive clinical samples are readily available, and/or appropriate contro]
materials (e.g. bacteria, viral genomes) are readily commercially available. None of those
are true for SARS-CoV2. There is tremendous concern about deploying a suboptimal test
into a challenging environment.

The EUA guidance from FDA is not unreasonable for the validation of a new respiratory
Virus test, and it gives an accurate picture of the amount of testing that is required to bring
on a new test by the lab. Federal law requires us to perform accuracy, reproducibility,
analytical sensitivity / LOD, and analytical specificity (cross reactivity) studies. Those
studies require positive control material inc/udingintact virus or RNA. Clinical labs are not
prepared to generate RNA transcript, and we don’t usually source these ourselves. We
can’t get the virus without filling out extensive paperwork that requires multiple
signatures. Getting control material for validation one of the biggest issues.
