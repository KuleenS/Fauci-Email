Tony,

As | am sure you are aware we recently web released the attached paper providing some initial
estimates of key transmission parameters associated with nCoV-2019 virus. It will soon be coming out in
a print issue and we would like an editorial to go with it. Might you be willing/interested in authoring
such a piece? Our editorials are typically about 800 words with up to 10 references. As soon as you
provide it to us we will web release it and then link it with the attached article in an upcoming print
issue. Are you interested?

Please confirm no potential COls.

Thank you for considering,

Lindsey
