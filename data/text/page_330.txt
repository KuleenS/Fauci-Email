TO ANSWER THE QUERIES: The proof contains in-line numbered query markers and a numbered list of
queries at the end. The query markers and the queries are linked, so you can jump back and forth within
the file. Please respond to all the queries (see below for instructions; please do **NOT** use e-
annotation tools) and convey any additional changes as needed.

TO RESPOND BY E-MAIL: If your corrections and your responses to the queries are straightforward, we
encourage you to respond by replying to this message. Please copy and paste the list of queries into an
e-mail message or a Word document and type your responses there. You may also include a list of
changes (e.g., page 1, line 20, change xxx to yyy). Again, please do **NOT** use e-annotation tools in
the PDF file; the marks are small and easy to miss, which may lead to errors in your article.

Please note that this material is confidential and embargoed until publication. If you have questions
