Subject: FOR YOUR REVIEW: Staff Communication on Novel Coronavirus

 

Good afternoon, Dr. Fauci and team:

Working in coordination with OHR, ORS, OIR, and others, we have developed two communication
products to address questions/concerns that are being raised by NIH staff related to the novel
coronavirus. The two products are:

1. All staff email from Dr. Collins to provide general information and guidance to NIH staff
2. QA for use by Executive Officers (not for broad distribution) on human resources flexibilities in
response to coronavirus

These products are provided for your review and guidance. We also plan to share with HHS for
review/awareness. The current plan to disseminate these products on Monday. We look forward to your
input.

Best,
Renate
