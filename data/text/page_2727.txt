Tony:
It was good to see you again at the ASM Biothreats Conference. We had worked together on the

Medical Countermeasure Initiative when | was the Medical Officer for the DOD Chem Bio Program
(under ASD Andrew Weber) several years ago.

 

If you or your staff have any interest, please feel free to reach out to me.

Hope you have a wonderful day!
