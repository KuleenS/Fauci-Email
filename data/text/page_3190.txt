The longer a virus circulates in a human populations, the more time it has to develop mutations that
differentiate strains in infected people, and given that the 2019-nCoV sequences analyzed to date
differ from each other by seven nucleotides at most, this suggests it jumped into humans very
recently. But it remains a mystery which animal spread the virus to humans. “There’s a very large gray
area between viruses detected in bats and the virus now isolated in humans,” says Vincent Munster,
a virologist at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who studies coronaviruses
in bats, camels, and others species.

Strong evidence suggests the marketplace played an early role in spreading 2019-nCoV, but whether
it was the origin of the outbreak remains uncertain. Many of the initially confirmed 2019-nCoV
cases—27 of the first 41 in one report, 26 of 47 in another—were connected to the Wuhan market,
but up to 45%, including the earliest handful, were not. This raises the possibility that the initial jump
into people happened elsewhere.
