Fred:

Thanks for the note. The answer is almost certainly yes, but there would not be enough of them whereby we can
compare the results in those who were receiving Hydroxychloroquine or not for their lupus. Large natural history
studies, which we will be initiating could possibly answer that question.

Best regards,
Tony
