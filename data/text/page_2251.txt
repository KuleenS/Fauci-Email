Subject: Urgent information about a Corona Virus Management Device

Dear Dr. Fauci

Given the gravity of the corona pandemic, my brother and | are reaching out
to make you aware of product that we think could help mitigate the spread of
the virus and protect health care workers as well as the public. We have
already tried the usual channels to contact the White House and the
emergency authorization use division at the FDA but also wanted to bring
this to your attention also.

Medixair™™ an ultraviolet (UVc) air sterilizer with proven, well established

unique patented germicidal technology to effectively and safely eradicate
viruses and bacteria up to 99.9%. It is capable of delivering a log6 reduction
in microbial concentration, by penetrating the nucleus of microorganisms,
disrupting their DNA thus destroying the ability of the organism to reproduce;
effectively rendering it harmless.

Medixair™™ is a portable unit and can easily be installed in a vanety of
settings including hospitals, emergency rooms, waiting rooms, dentist
offices, cruise ships and airport lounges. In both clinical trials and under in-
vitro testing conditions (see attached white paper), Medixair™ has been
demonstrated to be highly effective in protecting patients and health care
workers from pathogens (e.g. MRSA, Clostridium Difficile) and also by
preventing cross infection. Specifically, Medixair™™ was tested and found
effective for a strain of Coronavirus known as FCoV and thus COVID-19
would have the same susceptibility to eradication with UVc within a relatively
short period of time (attached).
