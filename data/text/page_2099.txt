enhance nonheme iron absorption, especially when an exercise-induced iron loss is
high or when no heme iron 1s consumed, such as in a vegetarian diet. Absorption of
heme iron is very efficient; the presence of red meat increases absorption of non-
heme iron +400%. Only 1-7% of the nonheme iron in vegetable staples in rice,
maize, black beans, soybeans, and wheat are absorbed consumed alone. Vitamin C
improves the rate of absorption of nonheme iron from red meats. Diets that include a
minimum of 5 servings of fruits and vegetables daily provide adequate vitamin C to
boost nonheme iron absorption. Calcium, polyphenols, tannins from tea, and
phytates (a component of plant foods), rice, and grains inhibit the absorption of
nonheme iron. Some of the protein found in soybeans inhibits nonheme iron
absorption. Most healthy individuals maintain normal iron stores when the diet
provides a wide variety of foods. However, if the diet contains large amounts of
oxalates and phytates from dark green leafy vegetables and whole cereal grains the
absorption of iron decreases due to binding with iron in the gut. High absorption of
heme iron is further advanced by foods containing vitamin C in an acid environment
found of the stomach. The recommended for daily iron intake is between 10-18
milligrams for adult males and postmenopausal females. Most endurance athletes
consume too much iron. Iron is added to breads, cereals, and most packaged foods.

From a computer-generated dietary analysis on 16 endurance athletes and 9 non-
athletes, iron intake from their reported food intake was assessed.

The results of this data is as follows:
GROUP

PERCENT DAILY IRON (RDI/RDA)
MALE ENDURANCE ATHLETE
279%

FEMALE ENDURANCE ATHLETE
193%

MALE SEDENTARY

158%

FEMALE SEDENTARY

115%
