detail for him. Fauci shrugged it off, telling reporters, “I’ve chosen this
life.”

The crisis that the world now faces comes as no surprise to Fauci. On
January 10, 2017, ten days before Trump took the oath of office, Fauci
delivered the keynote address at a conference at Georgetown University,
titled “Pandemic Preparedness for the Next Administration.” After
describing his years of managing epidemics, he posed a series of
questions to the audience: “Will there be a resurgence of Zika? We’re
getting into the summer in South America. Are we going to see a
resurgence or not? What about influenza? Are we going to get a new
pandemic?”

Fauci’s last point, he emphasized, was almost certainly the most
important: the possibility that some unknown, powerfully infectious
pathogen could emerge to threaten the world. “What about things that
we’ re not even thinking about?” he said. He let the question drift out
over the hall. ““What is for sure,” he concluded, “is that, no matter what,
history has told us definitively that it will happen.”

On the day that Anthony Stephen Fauci was born, the front-page
headline in the Times was “PRESIDENT TO GIVE EMERGENCY FACTS TO
NATION ON RADIO.” It was Christmas Eve, 1940. The Second World
War had begun, and the United States was less than a year away from
joining the fight.

Fauci grew up in southwest Brooklyn, first in Bensonhurst and later in
Dyker Heights, where his family ran a pharmacy and lived in an
apartment upstairs. The pharmacy was across the street from the Shrine
Church of St. Bernadette. When Mass was finished on Sundays, Fauci
recalled, people would walk over to get prescriptions filled and to buy
whatever else they needed for the coming week. Tony’s father, Stephen,
dispensed medications, and was known to customers as Doc. His
mother, Eugenia, worked the register, along with his older sister, Denise.
From an early age, Tony spent evenings and weekends riding around the
neighborhood on his Schwinn, making deliveries.
