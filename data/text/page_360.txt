It may well diminish somewhat as weather gets warmer. However, there is no guarantee that this
will occur. More likely that it will become seasonal and go down in our summer and resurge
next winter

To get 1 million deaths of 1957 would require 200 million infections at a
death rate of 0.5%. That seems high number of infections.

But what is the worldwide seasonal flu death numbers if the USA has 50,000
deaths in a bad year and the 1957 number of deaths was 116,000? The
WHO says 650,000 deaths worldwide from seasonal flu. So this could be
worse but by about 40% not an order of magnitude. Okay so | should be
more concerned.

And do you think it will go down in late spring with warmer weather?
