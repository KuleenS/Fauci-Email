Subject: Coronavirus containment modeling
Dear Dr. Fauci,

It has been many years since we corresponded regarding smallpox bioterrorism and vaccination control.

The attached paper on containing a community coronavirus outbreak from a few initial cases via isolation and
quarantine might interest you. The news is mostly good - isolation and quarantine can get the transmission rate
below epidemic threshold - but the key is rapid detection of infected persons. Also discussed are some ideas for
alleviating congestion in the hospital. [ hope that you find it helpful.

Best, Ed Kaplan
