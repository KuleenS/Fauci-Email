Dear David Morens, dear Anthony Fauci,

| realise it is not an influenza virus, but the outlook of your 2007 paper ("The 1918 Influenza Pandemic: Insights for
the 21st Century") seems to me to be very valid for the current coronavirus outbreak. Or put differently - your
statements and concerns from then mostly coincide with my thinking and worries now... :( .

So a question - what is your thinking now? Are the hospitals you're affiliated with hiring additional staff (yet)? Any
personal preparations?

Good luck to you and all the best for those close to you, kind regards, Sean Scherer
P.S. I guess part of the the reason ['m asking is, because I (a non-institutionally affiliated biologist), am in touch with
the university-hospital here (___- (&) (6)Germany), but my concerns are so far falling on deaf ears... But also just

reading the paper and seeing others come to the same conclusions - albeit on more theoretical grounds and multiple
years ago - made me want to reach out. Plus I guess I'm simply curious about what you think !
