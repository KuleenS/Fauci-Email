China / Science
Coronavirus’s ability to mutate has been vastly
underestimated, and mutations affect

deadliness of strains, Chinese study finds

e The most aggressive strains of Sars-CoV-2 could generate 270 times as much viral load as the
least potent type

e New York may have a deadlier strain imported from Europe, compared to less deadly viruses
elsewhere in the United States
