There are new indications that the incubation period for the virus could be longer than the currently
believed 14 days, with patients testing positive after much longer quarantine periods. This development
came as infections rose in South Korea, Japan, Iran and Italy and the head of the World Health
Organization warned that the window for stopping the epidemic was narrowing.

Here’s what we know:

Chinese leader Xi Jinping has been advised that the situation in Wuhan “remains grim and complex.”
@South Korea and Japan both reported a sharp spike in cases Saturday, with the number of cases in
South Korea doubling in a day. A fifth person died in Iran from the virus, while Italy now has 50
confirmed cases, making it the largest hot spot in Europe.

eChina reported only 397 new cases Saturday, as the rate of increase continued to decline, but an
additional 109 people have died. There continues to be a great deal of skepticism about China's
numbers as the criteria for diagnosing coronavirus keep changing.

@A team of international epidemic experts had Wuhan added to their itinerary in China, following
questions about why they wouldn’t go to the center of the coronavirus outbreak that has caused more
than 2,000 deaths in the country.

eScientists in China said they had isolated coronavirus strains in urine, raising the possibility that it
might be transmissible that way, as well as through fecal matter and respiratory droplets.
