note, Paul and | had spoken to Ambassador Birx in the last couple of weeks, and we have been in
contact with Irum Zaidi, Chuck Vitek, and the analytics team.

Let us know how would be best to set up a group webinar to present the information. Or feel free to
connect us directly with their schedulers. Think the models illustrate the low margin of error in the
large cities for resurgence risk, even as other less densely populated counties may be tolerant to
reopening strategies.
