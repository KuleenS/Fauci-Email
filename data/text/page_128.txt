Tony — sending you an email to say thanks for your steady hand at the helm in this current challenge
with Coronavirus. You are such an essential part of our government’s response to this public health

challenge.

Please let us know if there’s anything we can do at CAP to assist. We plan on hosting an event next week
and I’ll send you details as they come together.

Again, thank you.

Tony —

Thank you so much for participating in CAP’s podcast, Thinking CAP earlier this month. We think the
interview turned out very well and hope you think so, too.

Have a good rest of the month and Labor Day and | hope our paths cross again soon — either in the
neighborhood or at work.

Winnie
