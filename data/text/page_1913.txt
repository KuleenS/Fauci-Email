DALIAN, China -- An influenza medicine developed by a Fujifilm Holdings group member is
effective against the novel coronavirus, the Chinese government said Tuesday.

The government plans to officially recommend the drug's use for treatment. Fujifilm Toyoma
Chemical developed favipiravir, sold under the brand Avigan.

"It has a high degree of safety and is clearly effective in treatment," said Zhang Xinmin, director
of the science ministry's China National Center for Biotechnology Development, in a news
conference. Fujifilm Toyoma Chemical developed the drug in 2014, and it has been provided to
patients in Japan as treatment for the novel cornonavirus since February.

Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical signed a patent-licensing agreement for favipiravir with Fujifilm
in 2016. The drugmaker received clearance to produce the drug from Chinese authorities in
February and can ramp up output of a generic version.

The clinical trial was conducted at hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, with 200 patients
participating. Test results for those receiving the drug turned negative in a shorter period, and
their pneumonia symptoms improved at a higher rate.
