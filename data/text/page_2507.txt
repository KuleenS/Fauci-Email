| know the demands on you have skyrocketed, sol am circling back to confirm you are still
available on Friday March 20 for the COVID-19 event, and also to seek your advice, as we
amend the layout of the event, including possibly having it run a little longer.

1 am still hoping you can do a big picture scene setter (15-20 minutes with slides)

(i) The state of the science surrounding the virus, what we know and do not
know,

(ii) Progression of the outbreak

(iii) Testing

(iv) Status of accelerated early work on vaccines, antivirals

We will have a panel that covers China, and we may add a panel on the epicenters in Italy,
ROK, Iran

| would like to carve out ample space for discussion of the United States. In your view, is it
advisable to put a request forward to Secy Azar or VP Pence? Neither needs a platform to
have their voices heard. But perhaps they would see this sort of setting as an opportunity.
If not the Secy or VP, is there anyone else you might propose? | had reached out earlier to
Steve Biegun to speak on the foreign policy dimensions, especially regarding China, but
have not heard back.

| have separately reached out to the NGA about possibly enlisting a governor to speak.
