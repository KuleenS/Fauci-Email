Hi,
Sorry for the late response, | just flew back frong_ ©) @).

NIAD doesn’t have ongoing trials with chloroquine and | heard that such trials are being conducted in
China.

We are planning to evaluate chloroquine in animal models ASAP. If any therapeutic with a good clinical
safety profile ( like chloroquine) appears to be effective in vivo against COVID-19, we are planning to
quickly add to them to the Remdesivir therapeutic trial as another arm.

Let me know if you have other questions.
Kind regards,
Cristina
