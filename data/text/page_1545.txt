covers most Lilly insulins. Details and more information can be found in the press release
here attached.

Lilly has introduced several solutions in recent years to help meet the individual financial
circumstances of people living with diabetes that are still in effect during the COVID-19
crisis, including:

e The Lilly Diabetes Solution Center, through which representatives can direct
people to the $35 savings card, as well as affordability options that may reduce
their out-of-pocket costs further — such as free insulin for people with minimal
income, or no income at all, that has been donated by Lilly to non-profit
organizations.

e Three non-branded versions of our insulin options with list prices 50 percent lower
than the branded versions.

e In January, the company announced plans to donate at least 200,000 KwikPens® to
relief agencies over the next three years.

Hope all is well with you....
