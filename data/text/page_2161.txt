I would not use an age number, but if you had to I would say 70. I would say “serious”
underlying condition. Not sure about ACE inhibitors.

And, finally, ’m hearing that it’s puzzling that hypertension is such a risk factor and that
perhaps people on ACE inhibitors are upregulating receptors for ACE2 in the lung. Any
evidence of that? If so, maybe we should switch people off ACE inhibitors for now.
Thanks,

Jon:

Looks quite good. | suggest that you lean out there and explicitly say that the
elderly and certainly those with underlying conditions should voluntarily self-isolate
now.

Best regards,
