On a totally different note. Others have been plying with and
modifying the notional conops for a healthcare system.

I set up some simple rules:

1. Protect uninfected patients and staff from infectious patients and
staff (using all the tools that we have including home isolation and
home quarantine, cohorting/physical separation, PPE, telehealth,
etc.)

2. Provide acute care for COVID patients (continuum of ER-inpatient
care-intensive care)

3. Support mildly ill COVID patients in home isolation--telehealth

4. Support patients in voluntary home quarantine--telehealth
