Joe:

Thanks for the note. The has nothing to do with the validity of the test. We see
this with other viruses when you look at shedding. When there is a low titer of
virus, any specific site (in this case a nose or throat swab) may vary between
positive and negative even though the person is clearly still infected. It could be
that the virus is there in the throat at one point and cleared at another and comes
back again. Alternatively, it may be that the virus is always there, but at different
titers and at some points it is present below the sensitivity of the test, even
though the test is in general quite sensitive.

Hope that this is helpful.
Best regards,
Tony
