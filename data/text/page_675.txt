Cliff;

| am attaching 2 documents: 1) The revised manuscript that Greg worked on in which | have
added a number of tracked changes including deleting a substantial amount to get it between
800 and 900 words; and 2) A clean version where | have accepted all the tracked changes
(Greg’s and mine). Right now | like it the way it is and would not change it much if at all. What
it needs now is references. Greg will take a shot at adding the references. If you have
references, please send them to Greg and me. In the meantime, | will send it without
references to Bob Redfield for his review/approval. Let us discuss by phone if you wish.
Thanks,

Tony
