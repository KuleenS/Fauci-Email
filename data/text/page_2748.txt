Subject: Institutional request for information
Dear Drs. Redfield and Fauci,

| am writing on behalf of Columbia University, which has received a request from Dr. lan Lipkin to
transfer live novel coronavirus from Hong Kong to his BSL3 facility at the University. As we evaluate his
request, we note that he has approval from a CDC official to import the virus (see attached). However,
as we consider the risks and benefits of Dr. Lipkin’s proposal, we ask the two of you:

1. Is the CDC or NIH overseeing the distribution of the live virus in the U.S.?

2. Will you be the sole source of distribution in the U.S., or will institutions be permitted to obtain
it directly from other sources?

3. If it can be obtained from other sources, what sources will be permitted? For example, the
China or Hong Kong CDC or University of Hong Kong?

4. If you are to be the sole source, when would you expect to have a process for considering
requests?
