That is not what | said. | said for SARS the virus went from bat to civet cat to human; for MERS
it went from bat to camel to human. | said we did not know what the animal reservoir was for
the jump from animal to human with the novel coronavirus. Please tell her that. Thanks.

Q from Donna Young re comments In VP pool report:

Do they now know the novel coronavirus jumped from a bat to a civet cat [skunk]
served at feasts in China and then jumped to humans?

Is that the source for certain? Or was he just giving an example? Is there
something you can provide to show that information?

Thank you. Also, can you please clarify what was in the VP pool report today.

Do they now know the novel coronavirus jumped from a bat to a civet cat [skunk] served at
feasts in China and then jumped to humans?

ls that the source for certain? Or was he just giving an example? Is there something you can
provide to show that information?

Thank you again.
