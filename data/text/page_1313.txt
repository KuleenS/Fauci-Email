Subject: [WARNING: UNSCANNABLE EXTRACTION FAILED][EXTERNAL] Using grounded aircraft to treat
COVID patients

Please help us connect to the right people.

This could help save lives, get our economy restarted, and ensure continuity in the
government.

Hope you're good. Catch up on the other side. Have figured out how to save local
news.
