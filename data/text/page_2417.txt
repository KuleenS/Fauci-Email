Subject: Corona Virus planning
Dear Dr. Fauci;

| am a toxicologist and have spent time, years ago, working in the arena of oncogenic
virology as part of NCI programs. | am very concerned about what | see in the news
media about the NIH approach to the COVID-19 pandemic (yes, pandemic) that has
arrived in our country. There is much talk about development of a vaccine, however, |
believe that this is a long-term strategy. You and | both know, from working as
scientists, that the development and trial of an antiviral vaccine is a months-long
program, at best. | am surprised, even disappointed, that there seems to be no visible
focus on the part of the NIH on the development of anti-viral treatments (drugs etc) . It is
my professional opinion that anti-virals would take a shorter time to develop than
vaccines, yet it appears that this may be a back burner focus of NIH.

| realize that there are many political pressures on your office and | support your strong
efforts to apply science to the resolution of this growing problem. Please do not give
short shrift to the potential of antiviral treatments in favor of the longer-term promise of a
vaccine.

Respectfully yours,
