Subject: Dr. Fauci video request: Public Service Recognition Week

Hi there,

Please see below. HHS is taking over the Partnership for Public Service IG account next week for Public
Service Recognition Week. They asked if Dr. Fauci would be willing to do a short 30-second or less pre-
recorded video thanking public servants for their work. It would be featured during the takeover, and also
on NIH’s other sm handles next week. It can be taken on a cell phone as sm does not require higher
resolution. Let me know if you would like to accept or decline the request.

Many thanks,
Kim
