Subject: Seeking comment on Indian paper about new Coronavirus
Dear Dr Graham,

I'm a science journalist with news agency Agence France-Presse writing with a request -- apologies for
reaching out ona Friday evening! | was told by a contact you may be willing to give an opinion on this

paper that has just gone live https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871v1 full. pdf it

suggests the new Coronavirus has four inserts similar to HIV-1 and this is not a coincidence.
Thanks you very much, if you are able.
Issam Ahmed
