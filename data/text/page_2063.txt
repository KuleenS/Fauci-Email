Dear Dr. Fauci,

My name is Michael Liu. My family are living in [© © now. I have been following
spread of COVID-19 (Corona Virus) closely because such virus is very contagious and
dangcrous.

If a person is mildly sick with COVID-19, the CDC now suggests the person should “stay home
except to get medical care”, 1.€. home-isolation, according to
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/sick-with-2019-nCoV-fact-sheet.pdf

However, the home isolation may result in family spread of COVID-19 in certain kinds of
families, e.g., parents are infected but their kids are too young to take care of them, adults are
infected but their parents are too old and risky to look after them (if they live together), an old
husband/wife 1s infected but the spouse is too vulnerable to take care of him/her, etc. In such
scenarios, the home isolation may increase family spread and even community spread risks in the
US.

A great method to avoid home-isolation risks is the concentrated isolation, i.e. to isolate
mild symptomatic people in a concentrated place instead of their homes.

The concentrated isolation can avoid the above family spread risks, provide professional medical
help to isolated people, reduce mental pressure of other family members, etc., so that it can
reduce community spread risks. Such method has been proved to be effective by China’s war
against COVID-19.

The concentrated place can be a hotel, university dorm building, etc., which should be easily
managed for medical surveillance.
