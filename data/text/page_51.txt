Dear Dr. Fauci,

Nitric Oxide (NO) has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of influenza virus-
induced pneumonia in mouse model (Zablockiene et al., 2012).

Zablockiene B, Ambrozaitis A, Kacergius T, Gravenstein S. Implication of nitric
oxide in the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection. Biologija 2012; 58(1): 15-25.

NO overproduction in influenza virus pneumonia results from a sustained stimulation of
inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (INOS) (Akaike et al., 1996).

Akaike T, Noquchi Y, ljiriS, Setoguchi K, Suga M, Zheng YM, Dietzschold B,
Maeda H. Pathogenesis of Influenza virus-induced pneumonia: involvement of

both nitric oxide and oxygen radicals. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Mar 19;
93(6):2448-53.

NO overproduction in influenza virus-induced pneumonia can generate highly reactive
oxygen species, peroxynitrite, via radical coupling reaction of NO with superoxide
