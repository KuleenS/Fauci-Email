viral infection is stopped and the host cell survives. N-acetyl-cysteine, a
potent anti-oxidant and glutathione precursor, alters the redox state of
treated cells and can quench this same pathway (4,5). NAC (N-acetyl
cysteine) has been used to rapidly clear Rotavirus diarrheal infections in
children (6). Furthermore, the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus

(PEDV) coronavirus has been studied in Vero cells. In vitro, NAC blocks
that particular virus (7), and in vivo, NAC blocks intestinal damage caused
by this virus (8). NAC likely provides a "redox clamp" on the autophagy
pathway this virus exploits.

Since the PEDV coronavirus is effectively blocked in Vero cells by NAC, the
SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) will likely also be inhibited. This test should be
done, and if positive, clinical trials ought to follow.

Doses of 2.4-3.5 g/d of NAC have been used to treat patients with Lupus
(4). That dose is well tolerated and inexpensive.

If NAC were effective in symptomatic patients, it could add a cost-effective
measure of protection to healthcare workers and exposed individuals.
