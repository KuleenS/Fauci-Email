Subject: RE: FY 2020 - COVID-19 - Actual and Forecasted Spending - Weekly Report Ending 4/10/20

 

 

Tony,
YTD spending is $67.5M, unchanged* from last week. A summary is attached.

| have also attached an updated budget plan reflecting our projected spending by research category by
fiscal year. We are updating this weekly as we receive updates from the divisions on the timing of
clinical trials, observational studies, natural history studies and research resource needs.

We will report mid-week on our YTD spending which will be in sync with the data the Dept. extracts.

Martin

e The reason that we have reported no weekly increase is to match our reported spending with the
financial information that the Department is now extracting from our accounting system. We have
always included spending from our regular appropriation, as directed by the Department. Now the
guidance from the Dept. has been updated to report only spending from the supplemental COVID-
19 appropriations.
