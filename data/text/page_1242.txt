Team,

Anand Shah, Deputy Commissioner, reached out to the Stanford investigators on our behalf. Very
interesting information regarding their research and the test that they are using. They are interested in
partnering with us. I’ll let Anand give the details.

Anand will be reaching out to the MGH folks, as well.
