Thank you so much for you note. You brought back a flash of happy memory that was
wedged in the bottom of my brain. What a game that was! Billy Canavan and Donnie Walsh
versus Tony Fauci and Artie Guarino. You guys were clearly better than we were; yet we won
which proved to me then that anything is possible. Thanks again for bringing back such
amazing memories. | hope that you are well and | wish you all the best.

Warm regards,
Tony
