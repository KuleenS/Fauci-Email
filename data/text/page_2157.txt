Dear Dr. Fauci,
Thank you for your leadership during the current COVID-19 crisis. We're writing to ask
you to consider spearheading an additional initiative in this effort.

As you know, one of our greatest immediate needs is an adequate supply

of ventilators for use in hospitals. We will face a severe shortage of this crucial
equipment during a surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations. This will create a bottleneck
in our ability to deliver care, a situation where we have to triage who should
live and who should die. Tragically, we see this happening already in Italy.
This is a situation we must avoid.

So we propose to immediately help existing factories to increase production, to
convert other existing factories for the production of ventilators and to build new
factories to do so.

Some of this will take a long time to accomplish but this pandemic is also predicted
to be with us for a long time. We must stay ahead.

We should make an all-out effort to supply our hospitals properly and quickly. We are in
a time of war and we must make the commensurate effort now.

We believe we have the knowledge and the resources to do such a thing.

We just need the will, and the leadership.

We're writing to urge you to use your position of leadership to make this happen.
