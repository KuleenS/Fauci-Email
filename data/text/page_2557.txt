More on South Korea (sounds just like what happened at Jefferson
Barracks, just outside St. Louis, in 1918, armed with the exact same

SEOUL, Feb. 21 (Yonhap) -- The military is making all-out efforts to
prevent the new coronavirus from spreading further into the barracks,
officials said Friday, after the country's first infections in the armed
forces were confirmed.

Earlier in the day, a Navy sailor on the southern island of Jeju was
confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 in the first such case among
service personnel here.
