The appearance of community transmissions in Japan, South Korea, Italy and Iran is
troublesome. As | have repeatedly said over the past couple of weeks, if and when (looks more
like when now) a number of other countries besides China have sustained human to human
transmissions, then we are on the brink of a pandemic, if not already there. The reason to say
this is that when several countries have widespread transmission, then spill-over to other
countries is inevitable since one cannot shut out the rest of the world and so you can expect
increasing world-wide transmissions. Hence, you will be experiencing a pandemic. Weare not
quite there yet, but we are getting disturbingly close.

| hope that this is helpful.

Best,
Tony

Dear Dr. Fauci,
Just over a week ago we talked for this story about how the outbreak is likely larger than we know now:

https://www.googie.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/2020/2/14/21134473/coronavirus-
outbreak-singapore-us-symptoms-pandemic

Given the developments in Singapore, Iran, Italy, and on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, I’m just
wondering how your opinion about the possibility of containment and how fast we are approaching a
pandemic has changed. Do these developments suggest we’ve entered a new phase in the outbreak?

If you have a few minutes to chat or email today, let me know. We'll be aiming to run a story on this
today.

Thank you for considering.

Julia
