Dear Prof. Anthony Fauci,

At first, I express regret if I] am bothering you in your busy schedule.

I know you care about asymptomatic infection of COVID-19. COVID-19 1s
spreading rapidly all over the world, especially in Iran and Italy, and possibly even
more widely. Asymptomatic infections and healthy carriers are possible sources for
transmission. However, such sources of infection cannot be effectively identified due
to the symptoms absent. The research evidence 1s very lacking so far.
