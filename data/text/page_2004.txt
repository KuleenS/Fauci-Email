because it's possible (albeit unlikely) that some of what tell you is
new and possibly useful in, at least, saving lives in the USA.

I'm a physicist and have been modeling this outbreak since
January. My panic started minutes after I learned ~5M people
left Wuhan around January 22 a few days before the CCP starting
locking the country down. The 5M people scattered to 13,000+
cities in China to visit family & friends for the Lunar Festival
(Chinese New Year). I've been communicating with quite a few
people around the world including an NYU epidemiologist L__°49

. We've both been warning
our families, to mostly deaf ears at first, since January. It's been
frustrating and exhausting, but, finally, most are as prepared as
possible for what's about to happen.

I have lots of information about China due to my business,
scientific, friendship, and other ties with many there, including
immunologists & virologists at top-tier institutions and
laboratories. My WeChat account (like Skype / Whatapp) was
blocked by the CCP for 3 days late February / early March, but,
after a warning message, it is now unblocked. I'm willing to
share with you everything I know, think I know, or seriously
suspect.

Here are a few examples:

I'm confident that China stop counting dead COVID-19 infected
bodies since ~January 7, 2020. They've been adding fabricated
data daily to show (to save face) the world and their own people
an impressive flattening of China outbreak curve. It's easy to
prove this via data analysis because, for example, improbable
coincidences occurred in much of the data. My suspicions were
eventually confirmed by at least two of my sources in China

). The data posted by
China is not only garbage, it has misled the world into a false
sense of security wrt death rate, age vs death, and other things;
that is, if people analyzed the world's data including China, the
