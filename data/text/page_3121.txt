Also note the following from the author on the BioRxiv comment section:

This is a preliminary study. Considering the grave situation, it was shared in BioRxiv as soon as
possible to have creative discussion on the fast evolution of SARS-like corona viruses. It was not our
intention to feed into the conspiracy theories and no such claims are made here. While we appreciate
the criticisms and comments provided by scientific colleagues at BioRxiv forum and elsewhere, the
story has been differently interpreted and shared by social media and news platforms. We have

positively received all criticisms and comments. To avoid further misinterpretation and confusions

world-over, we have decided to withdraw the current version of the preprint and will get back with a

revised version after reanalysis, addressing the comments and concerns. Thank you to all who
contributed in this open-review process.
