many months to create. And I need to share those
thoughts with you.

My suggestion Is to treat actively-infected, and acutely ill,
patients (under carefully controlled procedures) with
allogeneic/ semi-allogeneic blood transfusions. The
resulting GVHD response should theoretically combat, and
eradicate the viral infection.

I look forward to your thoughts on this suggestion.

With best wishes to you and your family,
