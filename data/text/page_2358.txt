Hi Francis et al, | write to get a message to Tony, who clearly is on the COVID-19 front lines of these days and
“everywhere.” At this early stage, you may agree that it is possible that containment and/or mitigation will not
completely solve the current pandemic. Instead, effective treatment or amelioration of the worst complications 1s
necessary. In this spirit. | have an idea that was spurred by a letter in Lancet last month authored by Al Benevolent
(attached). In this communication they suggest that baricitinib (Oluminant; a JAK 1/2 inhibitor registered by Lilly
for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis), using in silico techniques. might be useful in the treatment advanced
COVID-19 pneumonia/ARDS identified . Baricitinib could possibly blunt the cytokine storm seen in the most
severely affected patients via inhibition of JAK 1/2, but also decrease viral entry in AT2 pulmonary cells and
myocardial cells via inhibition of GAK and AAKI. It is has a relatively short plasma half-life and hence could be
more useful than Roche’s tocilizumab/Actemra). Baricitinib has a good safety profile although as a drug to treat
autoimmunity it is formally contraindicated in patients with infections, this could be offset by treatment patients
with anti-virals such as Gilead’s remdesivir, etc. Perhaps you folks have already thought about/discussed its use but
if not I'd like a chance to chat about my additional thoughts. Thanks. Bill
