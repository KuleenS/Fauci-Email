Dear Dr. Fauci,

First let me say we are very grateful to everyone at NIH for working to contain the coronavirus,
especially your team at the NIAID. Your interviews are articulate and informative - they give Americans
some comfort and some concrete ways to think about protecting themselves and what to expect. It
must be a stressful time and we want you to know that we have confidence in our NIH and CDC to
contain it and to help stave it off globally as well.
