Abstract

Background: Although the SARS-CoV-2 viral load detection of respiratory specimen has been widely used
for novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) diagnosis, it is undeniable that serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid
(RNAaemia) could be detected in a fraction of the COVID-19 patients. However, it is not clear that if the
incidence of RNAaemia could be correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storm or with the specific
class of patients. Methods: This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General
Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were
divided into three groups according to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia
(version 6) published by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were
collected. The serum viral load detection and serum IL-6 levels were determined. Except for routine
Statistical analysis, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) analysis was used to establish a patient status
