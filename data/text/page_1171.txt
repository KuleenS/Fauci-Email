Hi Dr. Fauci,

Jon Yewdell suggested | contact you directly to expedite a briefing on the new county-level models that
our center, PolicyLab, at CHOP, will be releasing tomorrow. He shared with us your note below about
including Ambassador Birx and Bob Redfield as well. We'd be happy to do so, and had been in touch
with Ambassador Birx last week. We have also stayed in contact with the analytics team led by Irum
Zaidi and Chuck Vitek. | am also taskec to Governor Wolf’s crisis team in Pennsylvania and shared the
data with the Governor today.

Let us know next steps for arranging a video conference. Will arrange our schedule at your
convenience. Will have Drs. Paul Offit, Greg Tasian, and Jing Huang join from our team.

Best,
Dave
