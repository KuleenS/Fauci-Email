Subject: For review by 10:00 AM Weds: Peter Navarro coronavirus op-ed

    

 

 
     

Hi all,

Attached is a draft op-ed from the WH’s Peter Navarro regarding the administration’s coronavirus
response — covering PPE, vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.

There is a lot going on here so we’d like to have edits/recommendations/affirmative clearance from
FDA, COC, NIAID, ASFR, and ASPR.

Please send edits to me and Tim Foster by 10:00 AM tomorrow (Wednesday). Thank you!

Best,
Patrick
