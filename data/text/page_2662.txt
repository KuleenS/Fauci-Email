housekeeping or food
service or lab services
from entering areas
with COVID patients-
-think Ebola-like
strategies (not out of
concern of disease
transmission but
simply to limit
number of staff to
conserve PPE).

Could do something
similar with ERs
(akin to what
pediatricians do to
separate sick call
patients from other
appointments). I
have recommend
prioritizing PPE for
EDs and ICUs as well
as specific inpatient
areas where we would
likely initially cohort
patients, not pursuing
fit testing of
outpatient clinic staff,
and shifting patients
with mild COVID
disease to telephone
care and away from
outpatient clinics.

I know several of you
are part of large
healthcare systems.
Am curious how
others are
approaching this
challenge.

I am also resending
the questions I posed
