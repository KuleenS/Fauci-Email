John Giannone punting at FordhamCourtesy of John Giannone

The experiences that they shared forged many of them, such as Breen and Kay, into close
friends.

Giannone went to Fordham after being recruited to be a punter on the football team. During
training camp his freshman year, he quickly figured out the third-string punter would never see
the field. He went to Kay, then the WFUV sports director as a senior, to try to help on the station.
Kay said Giannone could do stats for him during the football season.

Kay went on to work at The Post, and later helped Giannone land an entry-level position at the
paper. When Giannone transferred into television at CNN/Sports Illustrated, it was through a
Kay connection. And Giannone landed at MSG Network after Kay left to become the TV voice
of the Yankees when YES Network began.

When it was Giannone’s turn as WFUV sports director, he made Papa and Curry a play-by-
player and an analyst when they were sophomores.

WFUV also got its staff access to locker rooms at places like Yankee Stadium and Madison
Square Garden to learn the craft next to professionals at the highest level. That remains largely
true today.

“WFUV allowed you to believe you were a professional broadcaster before you really were,”
Curry said. “We were in the heart of New York City, and, even if we weren’t Marv Albert, we
felt as if what Marv Albert was doing for the Knicks, we were doing for Fordham.”

There is a lineage that unites. Carrino learned how to describe the geography of a basketball
court from Glickman. Later, Carrino returned to Fordham and taught Ruocco the same lessons.
These days, at some Nets games, Ruocco is on TV, sitting next to Carrino, calling the game on
the radio.
