We are seriously considering using this platform to develop a rapid test to detect COVID-19.
Proof of principles that have been achieved toward that end are our demonstration that the
device can use two-step RT-PCR to detect influenza A and B in NP swab samples. The main
features of the device are described in the brief accompanying PDF.

| write now because we are unsure, if we were to produce a COVID-19 device, how it would be
deployed, by whom it would be used and who might be willing to purchase it. | would be very
grateful if you might be able to speak briefly with me and my colleagues about these open
questions. | am convinced this device can meet a major unmet need in clinical care and disease
control for this epidemic and we, as a group, want to make a difference. Your advice would be
invaluable as we weigh the risks and benefits of pivoting the company to this application.

With all best wishes; | hope all is well with you and your family.
