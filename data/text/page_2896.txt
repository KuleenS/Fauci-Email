Subject: Comment on NEJM details of "asymptomatic" contact in Germany

Hi Dr. Fauci,

I'm filling in for Molly Walker on the coronavirus beat while she's covering a meeting for MedPage
Today, but | wanted to see if you could were available to offer your quick reaction to the Supplementary
Index published today (attached) in the New England Journal of Medicine regarding the widely reported
asymptomatic contact in Germany.

Looking at the patient's daily take on how she felt it's unclear to me whether this qualifies as
symptomatic or not. | imagine this will be disputed.

Best regards,

-lan
