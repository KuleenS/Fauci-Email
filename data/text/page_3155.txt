Dear Dr. Fauci,

On behalf of our co-chairs for the winter meeting of The Business Council, David Rubenstein of The
Carlyle Group and Ginni Rometty of IBM, we would like to formally invite you to participate in our
meeting on February 20-21, 2020 in Washington, D.C. The theme of the meeting is “The Next Decade.”
(See formal invitation attached as wellas list of CEO members).

We would like for you to participate ina 50 minute fireside chat with David Rubenstein (and possibly Dr.
Francis Collins) to discuss the current coronavirus as well as what we should expect in the next decade.
We want to give our CEQs insights into what the next 10 years will bring in terms of detection, diagnosis
and treatment of diseases. All conversations are strictly off the record and closed press. We will cover
all lodging and transportation.

As you know, The Business Council is comprised of the chief executive officers of the largest global
corporations, representing all segments of the economy. We expect at least 150 CEO members, spouses
and speakers to be in attendance.

As a participant you and your spouse are also invited to join us for our special reception, dinner and
speaker at the REACH (Kennedy Center) on Thursday, February 20 at 6:30pm. It is the best opportunity
for you to meet our CEO members and spouses, speakers and other special guests in an informal
atmosphere.

lf you are interested and available, please let me know. We can also set up a very brief call with you to
discuss any additional details and answer any questions you may have. We look forward to hearing

from you and would be honored to have you participate with us again.

Warmest regards,
