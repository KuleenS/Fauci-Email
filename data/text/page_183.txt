Subject: As bad as measles?

Dr Fauci, you are the pre-eminent infectious disease physician in the world. I'm
concermed the public has lost perspective on COVID-19. At this point, it would
seem the r0 and CFR are more similar to rubeola than they are to Ebola. Can we
remind the public of that? Communicating that influenza will kill more Americans
than SARS-2 hasn't gained traction. Might someone like yourself or Dr Carson
communicate more strongly to the public the risks compared to other viruses they
are familiar with, like rubeola, rubella, varicella, etc?
