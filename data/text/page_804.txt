Tony,

| hope you andf{~__ ©) are doing well. You are doing an amazing job under difficult
circumstances. And just know we prefer the "real" Tony to the Brad Pitt version!!!

lam a bit perplexed by your seeming strong endorsement of remdesivir. Was it just a bit
forced?

My reading was the data were weak and in normal times for normal disease it is not enough to
to approve. And very unlikely to really impact COVID-19 disease pattern--regardless of supply
issues.

Stay safe
