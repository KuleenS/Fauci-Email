The crucial role of NO in influenza virus-induced
pneumonia was demonstrated on iNOS gene knockout
mice: at inocula sufficient to cause consolidating
pneumonia and death in the wild-type control mice, INOS
gene deficient mice survived with little histopathologic
evidence of pneumonia (Karupiah et al., 1998).

Both influenza and coronaviruses could have the same pathogenetic mechanism
of inducing pneumonia, namely harmful overproduction NO.

| would like to present you my innovative idea: Suppressing NO overproduction in
COVID-19 complicated to pneumonia with Methylene Blue (MB)

Arguments pro:

MB is known as a guanylate/guanylyl cyclase inhibitor but it is mainly a NOS inhibitor
(nNOS and iNOS).

MB is an inhibitor of superoxide generation by xanthine oxidase and NADH/NADPH
oxidases.

MB is a small molecule capable to penetrate in tissues and cells

MB was administered intravenously in patients with refractory septic shock and
Hepatopulmonary Syndrome of advanced liver cirrhosis.

MB administered intravenously will definitively reach the cells where NOS is induced by
COVID-19 complicated by pneumonia both in animals and humans:
