Please be “presumptuous” and go for it. Many thanks.

Francis, Tony-

| am certainly willing to do this so that neither of you have to, but | did not want to be presumptuous in
case either of you preferred a different spokesperson.
Please let me know how | should respond to Mary.

Thanks
Larry

Larry,

| have a favor to ask. Would you or a designee be willing to join a teleconference next week with our
alliance members to discuss NIH’s efforts to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on federally-
funded research? We would need no more than 30 minutes of your time, and can schedule around
you. Ideally, though, we could make this happen soon (to state the obvious, everyone is feeling the
need for touchpoints right now, and you are a wonderfully calming one for our university members!).

We could arrange the teleconference for as early as this Monday, the 16th: if there is a 30-minute
window for you or a designee between 1:00 pm and 3:00 pm on that day or within that same block of

time Tuesday, the 17", we'll commandeer it!

Thank you, Larry, for considering this ask. I’m sure it comes amidst many others.

NIH-000664
