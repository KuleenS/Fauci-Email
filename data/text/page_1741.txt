Subject: Interview with Dr Anthony Fauci in The Times of London

Dear Anthony,

I’m an editor at The Times of London. I’m getting in touch to discuss the possibility
of interviewing you this week for our Saturday Interview slot next weckend. You
have an incredibly tricky role in the fight against coronavirus and have spoken with
great clarity. We would love to speak to you about your position and predictions for
America.

The interview slot in question is the most prestigious in the weekend edition of The
Times - a double-page spread reserved each week for the most influential
individuals in public life. Former interviewees range from Boris Johnson to Jeremy
Farrar.

We would need 40 - 50 minutes of your time before Friday morning, but preferably
by Thursday evening. The interview can be conducted over Skype/Google
Hangouts/Zoom or whichever method of video chat you prefer.

We would be delighted if you were to consider our request.

Kind regards
Monique
