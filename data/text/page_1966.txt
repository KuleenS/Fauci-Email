Good morning, from Vancouver, Canada.
We hope you are keeping yourself, and your families safe.

Your calm approach, and real life experience being shared during the daily briefings
is what everyone looking towards the USA for information needs to see.

As in anything, real knowledge, both sharing and accepting is critical to get
everyone focused on overcoming the current situation.

We don't see social distancing between everyone at the news conferences, and
that is disappointing, we also don't see Donald Trump acquiring the skills and
abilities to truly turn over communication and leadership to people such as

yourself and your colleagues on the podium.

While that is also disappointing, it has come to be expected, therefore easy to tune
out.

Our Global world needs a Global approach of honesty and transparency, we can't
afford to get this one wrong due to our normal tribal tendencies.

Best regards, be safe,
