Hello Dr Fauci,

By way of introduction, | was Jim MacLowry’s last fellow at the NIH and have been working in the UK since then
as a medical microbiologist and hospital epidemiologist.

I am the lead medical microbiologist at the Royal Society of Medicine in the UK and was wondering about your
availability please to speak at a conference on emergent Coronavirus threats to be held at the RSM on November
24th coming?

The RSM is a unique educational charity here and we have councils covering all aspects of healthcare. The program
is still developing but I wanted to check on your availability quickly- we have an academic fund to which I can
apply to cover your trip but will need to do so soon.

It was both exciting and inspirational being a senior staff fellow at the NIII - my background is international;

: 5) (6) and the international perspectives
at the NIH were so encouraging. All non- American fellows recognised the national strategic remit of the NIH for
the US , but I have often wondered if an assessment has ever been made of how fellows like myself have brought the
spirit of that institution to other nations.

With kind regards,
lan
