The situation gets confusing. See attached brief commentary and e-mail string. As you can
see, | was too tired to make any sense of it. However, my deputy (Cliff Lane) notes that this
paper argues the opposite, i.e. that ACE inhibitors might have a benefit and counters the
argument to stop ACE inhibitor.s Bottom line is that we really do not know what the effect will
be clinically with respect to COVID-19. Inanyevent,[ EF
Best,
