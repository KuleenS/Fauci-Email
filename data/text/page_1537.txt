Tony:

For my syndicated column, I want to do a piece on the racial aspect of coronavirus. I’m not seeing any breakdown
of deaths in the poorer areas as opposed to the more prosperous ones.

Isn‘t that the telling statistic here that the economically less well off live in areas where medical services are
inadequate and as a result they have more underlying conditions that make theM more vulnerable? Isn’t it relevant
that people of color are predominantly among the poorer in our country for a variety of reasons?

| will appreciate your comments, particularly since you have so little to do these days.

Warmest regards,

Bob
