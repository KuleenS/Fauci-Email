Subject: Reporter working on coronavirus vaccine story

 

Hi Anthony,

| hope this email finds you well! My name is Amanda Morris and I’m a bioscience reporter at the Arizona
Republic, part of the USA Today network. I’m reaching out because I’m currently working on a story
about how some ASU researchers (Brenda Hogue, Bert Jacobs and Shawn Chen) are trying to develop
strategies to make a vaccine against the new coronavirus as well as a general platform they can use in
the case of future new coronavirus strain outbreaks in humans.

| know globally there are many researchers trying to develop a vaccine for this new coronavirus, and
that the NIH is working with Moderna to do so — and hopes to start testing with in a few months. I’m
woncering if | can talk to you over the phone and ask a few questions about the work that NIH is doing,
and what the broader challenges are for developing a vaccine? I'd like to have broader context about
vaccines for our readers.

Please let me know as soon as possible. You can call or text me at Z___ OF} Thank you!

All my best,
Amanda Morris
