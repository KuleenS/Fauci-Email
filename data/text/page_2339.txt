Hi Dr. Fauci,

I'm a senior journalist with the health unit at Canada's public broadcaster, CBC
News, and I'm hoping to speak with you for a national story on COVID-19
preparedness in the U.S. and Canada.

I'm wondering if you'd be free for a brief phone interview on how prepared the U.S.
has been throughout this outbreak and what further efforts need to be taken.

Thanks, I would only need five minutes of your time by phone.
Best,

Adam
