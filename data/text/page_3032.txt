BEIJING—Public-health experts around the world have been crunching numbers about the advance of
China’s dangerous new coronavirus to estimate how far and fast it could spread.

Studies published in recent days say the new virus appears to be more contagious than seasonal flu and
on par with the similar pathogen behind an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002 and
2003. The new virus’ mortality rate, however, is far below that of SARS.

China says that as of Sunday there were 5,142 infected people in Wuhan, the locked-down city where
the outbreak began. Some scientists estimate based on statistical models that the number could be in
the tens of thousands.

As health authorities race to contro! the outbreak, they are also scrambling to figure out, based on
imperfect data, how the virus is transmitted, the length of the incubation period and the degree to
which people without symptoms can spread the disease.

China’s health commission says incubation is generally between three and seven days, with the longest
period being 14 days, and that people can spread the virus before appearing ill. That makes a two-week
