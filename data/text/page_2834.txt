Thanks for the note. | do not know enough about the plumbing system on the cruise ships to
make any meaningful comments, certainly not any comments that could be attributable to
me. Andso, | will pass on this one, The best person to comment or opine on this would be
Mart Cetron of CDC. FYI, in case you do not have it in front of you, | am attaching the original
NEJM article on the Amoy Gardens Apartment story in Hong Kong with SARS.
Best regards,

Subject: Plumbing as possible means of spread of coronaviruses
HI] Dr. Fauci,
| hope you're doing well. | know you must be very busy.

Our editor, Dr. Elizabeth Rosenthal, is wondering whether the new coronavirus might be
spreading through plumbing on the cruise ship? She sent me these links, below, about how
plumbing played a role in spreading SARS in the Amoy Gardens apartment complex in Hong
Kong. Libby lived in China during the SARS outbreaks and remembers that the sinks there don’t
have the typical U-bend trap that sinks have here, which allows sewer gases and unpleasant
odors to come through.

If plumbing is a risk for spreading coronaviruses, what could be done to protect passengers on
cruise ships?

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this, even if just by email.

Thanks for your time.
