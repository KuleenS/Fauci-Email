COVID-19 threat, so | wanted to give you a heads up that a
game changer for enhanced detection of COVID-19 has
emerged. Thanks to DARPA &DHS S&T sponsorship in years
past of ANDE developing a real time Rapid DNA microfluidics
system for human identification, the ANDE group has a
breakthrough for detection of COVID-19 and to the future, other
emerging threat viruses.

As you may know the ANDE system for human identification (e.g.
CT &DHS missions) is mature and now deployed
operationally/tactically by CENTCOM, DIA, the IC and used most
recently by DHS in their recent test bed in El Paso to
demonstrate its effective capabilities to determine family
relationship in undocumented minors. Additionally ANDE is in
use by law enforcement and by officials responding to mass
casualty events (CA 2018 Camp Fire disaster, 2019 Conception
dive boat fire, and the very recent 2020 tragic helicopter crash) to
ID the victims.

The ANDE system now provides 2 hour turnaround with no
special training requirements as a stand-alone system for all the
above users. Our warfighters and special operators are using
the ANDE system now in field forward operations and it meets
MIL specs &is the only system certified for data submission to the
DoD ABIS/DIA DNA repository and FBI CODIS data base. The

   

executive Summary and a more in-depth document for your
teams review. Hope the above is helpful and | stand ready to
provide any additional information. | have cc'd Jim Davis (ANDE
Chief Federal Officer). Additionally since it has been some time
since we have worked together | have attached my bio and that
of ANDE's Chief Scientific Officer &Founder, Richard Selden
M.D., Ph.D.

Tony thanks for considering this in your very busy life now and |
will look forward to seeing you again.

Best regards--

Starnes
