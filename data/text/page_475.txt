Subject: Flip Cards

| have gone over the Flip cards. | note that we have only 2 cards for
Coronavirus. | want to have a separate flip folder for coronavirus with a full set
of cards for the specific coronavirus hearings that are coming up. You should sit
down with me and also work with Hilary to prepare this set of cards. They should
contain all the current epi as well as the dollar numbers for the proposed
supplemental budget that we are putting together — | will get asked about that
and | have clearance from the department to talk about it. Also, | want a set of
cards for what we are doing in the area of research, i.e. basic research (eg animal
models, etc.), diagnostics, therapeutics (remdesivir trials in China, Japan, and
Nebraska), and the whole menu of vaccines. In other words, | want an entire set
of cards for coronavirus. That is what! am going to get asked in both the
coronavirus hearings as well as in the NIH Appropriations hearings.
