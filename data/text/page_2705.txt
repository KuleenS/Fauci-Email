Tony,

The Thai Ambassador has invited you, and CDC, to lunch at his residence either 27 Feb or 4
March. They didn’t have your contact and asked (per below) if | could contact you to

ask. Dr. Redfield is in Washington, DC on 27 Feb and | will ask if he wants to attend. If you
or your staff can let me know, | will get back with them.

Best regards,

Mitchell Wolfe, MD, MPH

Dear P Mitch krub,
Ref: invitation for Lunch on 27 Feb OR 4 March

1. Hope all is well with you. Hopefully you had some rest last weekend. Since you were
living in Thailand for a while you must be missing authentic Thai food. Ambassador Thani
