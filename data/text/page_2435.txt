Hello and thank you for all of your tireless efforts in dealing with the coronavirus.

| have a concern about the universities and the spread of this virus. Many schools
brought back students from study abroad before the 14 day quarantine was put
into place, and even after the quarantine was put in place, many students did not
follow the quarantine rules. Also, with shared dorms and apartments it was not
possible for student's who returned to campuses and not their homes. By the times
schools came up with a plan for quarantining the student's it was well over a week
after some were back. Therefore, there is potential for widespread infection.

The vice president said the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions
are at risk and should take caution in where they go, avoid crowded places
etc..Millions of students have asthma, diabetes, auto-immune disorders, and they
do not have a choice other than to go to class. The government does not seemed
concerned about the potential spread among campuses and what a disaster this
could be. They have voiced why grade schools are not closed (since younger are
not at risk s better for them to be at school) but they are ignoring college kids are
at risk and the impact of widespread infection on a campus could be huge.
Students ir’) @ colleges travel back and forth to the city all the time, and! am
concerned schools are not temporarily closing until more testing is available and
we see where this goes. At minimum, giving student's with underlying medical
conditions the option to go home and work remotely. Right now they do not have
