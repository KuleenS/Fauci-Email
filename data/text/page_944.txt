ADM Adams:

Thanks for sending this. There has been a lot of guidance on disinfection and
cleaning, notably some very recent collaborative work we have done with
EPA (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/reopen-
guidance.html). Attached are two documents focused on re-opening America
with emphasis on cleaning and disinfection, including high-touch surfaces.
Also below are a number of websites that address cleaning and disinfection
which point out the importance of disinfecting high-touch locations like
doorknobs. They give guidance how to clean them, but they don’t address
methods for using a paper towel or Kleenex to first turn the knob and then

discard the towel, (——_______ 90}
