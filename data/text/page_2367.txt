Dr. Fauci, how are you sir?

Long ago, in the early 90’s, | was a post-doctoral fellow in the Laboratory of Viral and Molecular
Pathogenesis at NIH. | don’t know if the same lab is still there. Now | work on brain injury and
Alzheimer’s but my interest in viruses and mechanisms of viral pathogenesis has not waned and the
recent covid-19 outbreak prompted me to doa little investigation on my own.

My studies of blood microRNA changes after TBI and AD suggest that principal component analysis of
distinct changes in circulating miRNAs can identify the patient population. MicroRNA alterations can be
measured by real-time PCR which | presume is the basis of the test that is developed for this disease but
| am analyzing blood miRNA-seq expression profiles and now it is possible to quickly sequence blood
samples in a few hours and get accurate results. Blood gene expression in my studies was more variable
(lots of RNases in blood) so I found that microRNAs are much more stable in blood and serum samples.

| attach an example of a PCA/hierarchical clustering heatmap analysis of a GEO dataset for MERs-coV
from 2016 https:
| performed the PCA and heatmap analyses at two different stringencies and you can see that the

patients can be unequivocably distinguished from the controls at very significant p and FDR values.

 

Just a thought but many clinical centers, hospitals, academic institutions can quickly perform
transcriptome-wide sequencing. Blood RNA can be isolated in 1-2 hrs, sequencing libraries made ina
few hres and one miRNA sequencing run can handle up to 48 samples and the data can be quickly
analyzed.

Just my two cents on how NIH could accelerate the analysis of new blood samples for this new strain of
coronanvirus. You could mobilize hundreds of sequencing centers to help in the analysis.
