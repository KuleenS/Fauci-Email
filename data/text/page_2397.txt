Remdesivir has never passed a Phase 3 trial, but has already made big headlines in
major international newspapers. Neither South Korea nor Germany or Scandinavian
countries have yet used this drug.

I understand that this is a (relatively) long shot, but given the number of lives at stake,
I would recommend that a carefully scrutiny by the scientific community on the use of
this drug is warranted.

I have no conflict of interest.

Thank you for your attention".
