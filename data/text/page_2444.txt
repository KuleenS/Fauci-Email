Subject: Pneumococcus vaccination in relation to coronavirus infection.

Dear Anthony Fauci,

As I understand the fatal cases of covid-19 develop pneumonia after several days of

symptoms of the acute viral infection.
In this way the present conoravirus infection is very like our present and previous

fatal influenza virus infections. In the 1918 pandemic many if not most of the fatal

cases were caused by bacterial superinfection with hemolytic streptococci and

pneumococci. The former is rather seldom now, but the pneumococcal infections are

common.

Should we advice persons over >65 y as well as people with chronic diseases with

increased risk of fatal coronavirus diseases to be vaccinated against pneumococci
now?
My best regards and thank you for your significant contribution to inflammatory
medicine and infections.
