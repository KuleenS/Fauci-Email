Subject: NIAF and coronavirus

Dr. Fauci, | trust this email finds you well. It has been a few years since we’ve seen one another
on the Hill or at a NIAF event but hopefully we will rectify that soon.

| know you have a lot on your plate, especially with the coronavirus, but | am curious if you have
five minutes for a call tomorrow so | can introduce you to my boss at BDO, Eric Jia-Soboda

(https: //www.linkedin.com/in/eric-jia-sobota-02156036/). Eric is an expert in cost accounting
for Life Sciences companies and he wants to glean your perspective on the likely structure of the

emergency coronavirus budget request so that NIH and others can maximize those research and
implementation dollars at the most rapid pace. We would certainly appreciate your time.

My best, Elvis
