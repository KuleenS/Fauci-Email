Dear Dr. Fauci,

| don't want you to waste too much time in this stressful situation.

As the doctor in charge of the hygiene of the Berner clinic in Crans-Montana in Switzerland, as well as
being in contact with my colleagues in private practice, | see every day how important the need for
information and consultation of the population in this situation of insecurity is. At the same time, we are
under threat of a shortage of doctors if we have to strictly apply the federal swiss guidelines (Art. 10b
and 10c, regulation 2 COVID-19) or if the wave of illness reduces the number of colleagues available for
consultations.
