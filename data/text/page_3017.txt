Subject: Comment on story about how confident people feel about their govt's response to a health
epidemic

 

Hi Dr. Fauci,

| hope all is well. I’m working on a news story tied to the coronavirus outbreak and tying it to how
people responded to a recent global Ipsos poll about the threat of a major health epidemic in their
country in the next 12 months. https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2019-
11/a-more-dangerous-world-fear-2019.pdf

| was hoping to get your comments on this, considering your expertise in infectious disease control.
Below are some questions. If you could respond via email, that would be great as | am on a tight
deadline to get this story up. /f it’s easier to give you a call, | can do that as well. Please let me know
what works best. The story will be published on Ipsos.com, on social media and our various country
websites. Thank you and | look forward to your response.

1. In our survey of more than 18,500 people in 28 countries done in late last summer, more than
half (51%) of people said there was threat of a major health epidemic in their country in the next
12 months with people in emerging markets at the top of the list. Are you surprised by this
result? It’s among the highest reading for this question since the Ebola outbreak in 2014 when
the percentage climbed to 59%.

2. The U.S. is the only developed country in the top 10 list where most people think a major health
epidemic will occur. Why do you think this is?

3. A follow up question to the previous one is how confident people are that their government
could protect them or respond effectively if such an outbreak was to occur. Over half globally
said they were confident in their gov’t’s response. Do you think people have a lot of trust in
those in power to do the right thing in times of an outbreak?

4. Seven of the top 10 countries where people had the most confidence in govts are in the
developed world. How important are developed healthcare systems when it comes to outbreaks
like the coronavirus?

5. Likewise, many countries at the bottom of this list are emerging markets. What can govts in
these countries do to ease peoples’ fears on how they are or will handle an outbreak like the
coronavirus ?
