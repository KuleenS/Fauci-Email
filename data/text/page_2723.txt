Hi, Tony,
lam very distressed by the Face of the WHO. Their public face, their news updates, are of the quality of
those of a third world country. | only hope that they function better than their news updates suggest.

They need a world class public relations firm.

| am deeply concerned re Covid-19 in India (with a population of 1500 million) and Africa (population
100 million). News reports do not mention anything of this pandemic waiting to happen.

Hope that you are well and getting a good night's rest.

Best,
Dick
