Dear Dr. Fauci,

I am delighted that you have agreed to write a signed editorial to accompany the article on the initial estimates of
key transmission parameters associated with nCoV-2019 virus by Li et al.

The general purpose of the Journal's editorials is to provide the reader with an authoritative interpretation or
elaboration based on the substance of the article. Since this substance is usually not within the average reader's
special competence, such readers will particularly benefit if the editorial avoids technical jargon, explains the
articlc's contribution to a ficld of knowledge, and emphasizes, whenever possible, its clinical implications. The
editorial commentary should not be concerned exclusively with the article in question but rather should use the
article as a starting point for a more general discussion.

Because editorials involve interpretation and opinion, you and your potential coauthor must be free of significant
relevant financial associations (including equity interest. regular consultancies, or major research support) with a
company, or with a competing company, that stands to gain from the use of a product discussed in the editorial.
Please contact me immediately if you are considering a coauthor, so I can ensure that your candidate meets our

NIH-001756
