Bob:

Please take a look at this. This question evolved from a teleconference that |
had 2 nights ago with people “in the trenches” including Alison Arwady
(Chicago). The question is what will be the relationship between the public
health workforces at the federal and local levels. Youi had spoken of the CDC
people that will be assigned locally and that will help build up a local workforce.
How will CDD interact and relate to the locals. Is there any possibility of Federal
funding of their proposal (see attachment). If not, do you have any suggestions
for them? Ican discuss this with you today at the Task Force meeting. Thanks.
Best,

Tony
