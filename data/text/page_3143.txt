This is a meeting aimed at setting research priorities and | do not believe that it impacts or
overlaps with the Tedros proposal. | will have my staff submit some names (mostly high level

Hi Tony,

Just encountered this message from Soumya of WHO, inviting attendance at a meeting in
Geneva on Feb. 11-12. I’m not sure how that will fit with the Tedros proposal.

Who would be the right persons from NIH to propose for Soumya’s meeting?
