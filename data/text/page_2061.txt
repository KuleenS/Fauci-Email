Dear Dr. Fauci,

My name is Jason Willick with the Wall Street Journal. | was wondering if you would be willing to talk to
me for the WSJ weekend interview section on pandemics and the coronavirus—the US response but
also the broader challenges from infectious disease. | know you are beyond busy, but! thought I’d ask.
Let me know if this is a possibility and I can discuss more details.

Jason
