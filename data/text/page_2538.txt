Tony —

Could one of your folks give me a quick read out on this please? (should | reach out to
Hilary Marston?). This is the paper that DOE alluded to in the initial conference call we had
with OSTP. I will respond informed by your staff’s guidance.

Dr Hahn and the FDA team in particular, but with input from relevant SMEs at CDC
and NIH, please give the brief attached document and quick read on comment on the
usefulness of us setting up a session with the folks at DOE today to discuss further.
Many thanks
