1. CSIS podcast “Coronavirus Crisis Update” with Congresswoman Susan Brooks (R-IN). She
cosigned the CSIS OpEd with Ami Bera on the CRC and opens the episode with a discussion of
engaging the returned Peace Corps volunteers https: Lwww. csis.org/podcasts/take-

 

a great series by the way.)

2. On Mar 27, 2020, Congressman Mike Quigley (D-IL-05) introduced the Mobilizing America to
Help Act, “which would direct President Trump to invoke his existing authority to detail Peace
Corps volunteers who have returned to the US from their posts, to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) to support emergency relief in the wake of COVID-19.”

3. Baltimore Sun column DAN RODRICKS, APR 03, 2020, “Put Peace Corps volunteers to work on
U.S. soil to fight COVID-19”: https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/columnists/dan-

4. Good conversations with Marcus @ASTHO and others today. Important to emphasize that state
and local authorities have the lead. This would not be “federalizing” the response. It would be
making federal employees available by request to integrate in state- and local-led activities.
Some will welcome the extra hands. Some will prefer to have funding to do their own hiring.
Paying salaries of state employees at risk for furlough to work on COVID-19 will make a lot of
sense, but won’t be enough. Need a menu of options.

5. Many concepts and plans for public health and social response are being circulated. All of them
will need an expanded workforce.

 

Outreach:
6. I’min touch with someone in Adam Boehler’s office. Other outreach welcome.
7. lemailed Peggy Hamburg. No reply yet. Other outreach welcome.
8. Anyone who can contact Scott Gottlieb?
9. Here again is Monday’s list: NGA and individual governors. Republicans who will be most
interested and helpful are Baker (MA), DeWine (OH) and Hogan (MD). Democrats: Cuomo,
Pritzker, Newsom, Whitmer, Inslee. AMA, ASTHO (done), APHA all good potential champions
