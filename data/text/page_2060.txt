Richard Preston pointed me in your direction, saying you would be the right person to help me think
through a potential hearing on codifying the global health security team on the National Security
Council.

The hearing (as of right now in my mind} would

1. Examine the lessons learned from the Ebola and other previous outbreaks about how federal
government design and operations can facilitate or hinder global health and stemming
pandemics;

2. Analyze how eliminating the global health security team has put us several steps behind where
we need to be in fighting coronavirus; and

3. Argue for codifying the team and its leadership as part of the larger national security apparatus
and avoid kowtowing to outbreak fatigue.

I’m hoping you might be willing to speak with me about your expertise and thoughts in this area. I’m
definitely not the expert and | would love someone with your background to ensure I’m getting this
story right — and that | have the right people at the witness stand to tell it.

Would you have time to talk today or some time very soon? We are hoping to have this hearing next
week.

Yours,

Wendy
