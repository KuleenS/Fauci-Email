Hello Dr. Fauci. |am a[{@)©} pharmacist from Ontario, Canada. | was just reading an article that stated
covid-19 cases in children under nine y.o. are almost non-existant. | wondered why, and then an answer
dawned on me. They have an immunity because one of the childhood vaccines all children get is giving
them cross immunity to coronavirus as well. A study should be done immediately to see which one gives
cross immunity, if indeed that is the reason for their seeming immunity to this virus. The immunity must
wear off over time which is why adults and seniors seem to lack prior immunity and get sick. This
hypothesis is certainly worth investigating. If this is what is happening, maybe millions of lives could be
saved by a simple booster of an existing vaccine. Please let me know your thoughts on this matter.
Thanks for your time. Rob
