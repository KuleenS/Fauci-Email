Subject: Council of Scientific Society Presidents Support of Science Award

 

Dear Dr. Fauci;

Council of Scientific Society Presidents (CSSP) would like to honor you with our
Support of Science Award at our May Leadership Workshop (virtual). The purpose of this
award is to honor those who have proven their outstanding support of U.S. science, free
scientific communication, and a support of basic science research. The expertise with
which you guide the United States through these unprecedented COVID-19 times simply
reinforces the dedication you exhibit to ensure the greatest safety to the greatest number
of US citizens.

Dr. Martin Apple talked to Kim Barasch earlier this week. Please find the attached formal
invitation letter she indicated that was needed. | have also attached a PDF of a brochure,
though most information is on our website.

If you or Kim have any questions, please let me know by email or phone.
Sincerely,
Sharon Mosher
