Dear Doctors,

I don't know if you have got this infomation.

A truly deadly virus

cannot spread very far. Why? Because people quickly get sick and die. In
other words, they cannot spread the virus further, which is a prerequisite for
a large spread like corona. Covid-19 has spread throughout the world.

The premise is that it is not very dangerous, it causes mild symptoms for
most people, many do not even notice that they were sick. But the virus has
different phases in the body, after a while it goes into a resting phase, you
feel better, but the virus is still present and can pass on. Covid-19 is an
optimally developed virus that spreads rapidly around the world. But if it
were really deadly, almost everyone would die.
