Dr. Fauci:

We've been seeing a lot about people saying the heat will kill the novel coronavirus? Is this medically
sound?

Trump discussed Coronavirus briefly: He said he had a long talk with President Xi two nights ago, and the
Chinese president told him “the heat generally kills this kind of virus.”

The president claimed the virus will go away in April as the seasons change: “The virus that we’re talking
about having to do a lot of people. We think that goes away in April with the heat,” he said.
