Hello Dr. Fauci,

I hope you will see this message. The subject line is part of the equation, for Covid-
19, in the US which is an unknown. I am highly concerned how It will affect this
group. Please let all healthcare systems know to be aware and have this on their
radar. We keep hearing it’s for older adults but it’s for people with compromised
lungs among other all pre-existing conditions you’ve mentioned.

Sincerely,
Lyzzy Crouse
