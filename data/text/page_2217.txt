Dear Dr Fauci,

Thank you.

Your efforts to inform and help all of us during the Covid-19 situation are greatly appreciated.
You are in our prayers.

Sincerely,

Diane Gaary

PS. I ama speaking voice teacher.
If your voice is tired from the constant talking, here are 2 easy suggestions:

1) a closed mouthed yawn (as one might de in a boring class) is a quick stretch and tension reliever for the entire
vocal mechanism

2) 10-20 minutes of constructive rest (on your back with knees bent and head on a book to keep it inline with your
spine) will put your spine into a passive traction and give your back and neck muscles a chance to rest and release

I know you don’t have much time for this sort of thing, but decreasing your physical stress will help your voice
tremendously and help you work even more efficiently.

Once again, Thank you for your knowledge commitment, and integrity.
