Dear Jeremy, Tony, and Francis,

Thank you again for your advice and leadership as we have been working through
the SARS-CoV-2 'origins' paper. We're happy to say that the paper was just accepted
by Nature Medicine and should be published shortly (not quite sure when).

To keep you in the loop, I just wanted to share the accepted version with you, as
well as a draft press release. We're still waiting for proofs, so please let me know if
you have any comments, suggestions, or questions about the paper or the press
release.

Tony, thank you for your straight talk on CNN last night - it's being noticed.

Best,
Kristian
