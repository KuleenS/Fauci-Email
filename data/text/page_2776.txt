Dear Dr. Fauci,

In the March 2020 issues of Pharmacist’s Letter and Prescriber's Letter, we plan to write about
coronavirus.

Pharmacist’s and Prescriber’s Letter is an independent advisory service for pharmacists and physicians.
We are not affiliated with any other group, organization, or company. We are 100% subscriber
supported. Our focus is providing practical, unbiased advice to subscribers on issues related to drug
therapy. Each month we turn to experts like you to help us pin down the most relevant and important
information to share with our readers. Our newsletter is well known for being concise and accurate. You

will notice the excerpt we are sending you is relatively short.
