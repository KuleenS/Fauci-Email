Hi Tony,

| know how busy you are but | wanted to give you a brief update on the Annual
Conference of the Consortium of Universities for Global Health (CUGH) based in
Washington, DC. Here is the link to the overall CUGH meeting which provides an
overview of the whole conference https://www.cugh2020.org/program. As we

discussed months ago you agreed to be in the opening day plenary session on

April 18" entitled ”Emerging Infectious Diseases and their Impact on Global
Health Security”. The details and other speakers are listed below. | may try to
organize a call of all speakers in a month to coordinate talks/topics as the session
is 90 minutes with 5 speakers, and a lot of ground to cover, especially with the
COVID19 outbreak.
