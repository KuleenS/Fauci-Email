Subject: ASF: From Jack curry/ YES Network (Yankees)

Jack Curry (broadcaster with the YES Network, which is like MASN, but for the Yankees) is appealing to
you as a New Yorker and lifelong Yankees fan for a 10-minute interview via Zoom. Jack covered the
Yankees for 22 years at the NYT. The interview would run on YES (largest regional sports network in the
country) as the focus of one of the original shows they are producing 3x/week called “YES, WE’RE HERE.”
It would be run across all of their social media platforms (reach of over 1M). They would also air clips on
the Michael Kay Radio Show (TV play-by-play announcer for the Yankees), which is simulcast on YES and
is the highest-rated drive time talk show in New York.

Questions below, including a few at the end about your lifelong baseball fandom. Is this something
you'd be willing to do? If so we will seek clearance.
