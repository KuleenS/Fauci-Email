Jean-Francois:

Thank you for your note. | do not see Yazdan copied on your e-mail, andl so
please forward this e-mail to him. The NIH position is that we should preferably
make drugs available on randomized, controlled clinical trials and not freely
distribute them. There is a strong push in the USA, favored by the President, to
make certain of these drugs more widely available outside of an RCT using
mechanisms such as “compassionate usage”. In the USA, as you know, HC
(plaquenil) is an approved drug for malaria as well as for certain autoimmune
diseases such as SLE. Thus, physicians can prescribe the drug on an “off label”
usage. This likely will be the major modality of distribution of this drug in the
USA, at least for the foreseeable future.

| am copying Cliff Lane on this e-mail. Please include him on any further
correspondence on this subject.
Best regards,
Tony
