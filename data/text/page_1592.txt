Hi Dr. Fauci, my name is Amit Sachdev. I am a White House fellow and physician
most recently at the Brigham.

I know you are super busy and I would love to partner with you and write a op ed on
coronavirus and unite the nation.

If you have a few minutes, I would love to speak. | think |

 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Amit
