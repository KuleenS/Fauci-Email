lost in the pile. Anything that you can do to help would be welcome.

Dear Tony,

| hope that all is well given our current circumstances. | am sure you are very busy, so apologize for the
intrusion, but would love your insight if you have a moment.

| just had a very interesting talk today with Wendy Ginsberg on the House Committee on Oversight and
Reform, with an opportunity to testify at a hearing next Wednesday (email attached).

While | am very excited for an opportunity to advocate for further funding and operational support for
pandemic preparedness, | also recognize that this format may not be the right one to do so. Moreover, |
may not be the right person to do so, as | think you, Francis, or Eric Lander would do far better than

me.

| imagine they have already asked you to participate, and would just love any insight you might have as
to whether | should consider doing this, and if so, how | should proceed. | really only would want to do
so if it is a place where | can help the larger infectious disease community and make a positive
nonpolitical impact.

Thanks so much for your consideration,

Pardis
