Hello Dr Fauci: Hope you’re holding up well. Remember to rest and hydrate!

We had a DHS person tell us epidemiology models for US show worst case scenario 98m get COVID-19
and 500k dead.

’ve seen models all over the board. And Dr Jen and | are keeping our coverage on point on what we
know and what we don’t know.

If that a possible number for our planning? Or is that outlandish?

Thx.
