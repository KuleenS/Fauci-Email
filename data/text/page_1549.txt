Subject: Supporting Schools In Covid-19

Dr. Fauci -

I’m a safety/security consultant to independent and charter schools. I run a firm supporting
~1,000 of them. What, if anything, would you want them to know? I'm wondering if there's
any chance in the world you'd be willing to join us and a few hundred schools for a 15 - 30-
minute webinar one day next week?

Specifically, schools are looking for information/perspective as it relates to what to expect as we
return to a new normal and the like. Beyond that, they've begun to ask questions such as what we
can be thinking about for this short period of time between the return to school and the
development of a vaccine. What would best practice look like for us to educate, but maintain
social distance? I believe we can manage a lot of the operationalizing but would be

immensely grateful for some high-level guidance to follow.

I recognize how incredibly busy this time is for you and would be so incredibly grateful for any
time you might be willing to spare for this audience.

With immense gratitude,
