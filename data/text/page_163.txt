Thanks for the note. You make a valid point and | appreciate what you are
saying.. Onthat issue, | have been vocal about making sure that we do not
stigmatize Chinese people here in the USA or anywhere in relationship to the
COVID-19 outbreak.

Best regards,

Subject: kudos and comment about JAMA Coronavirus article

Dear Tony,

Wonderful articles in JAMA and NEJM. So glad you are still heading NIAID- it is comforting that there
are experts of your caliber still in the room. And thrilled that the NIAID has done so much to develop
rapid timelines for DNA vaccines and that you highlighted that progress in the article, since people call me
the "Mother of DNA vaccines,”.

As a former NIAID Council member, | felt | should write to raise an issue that | am sensitized to as a
scientist who is ethnically Chinese while American:
Why in the JAMA article was it necessary to state that the first travel-related case to the US was a
Chinese man (italics mine) who had visited Wuhan. Did his being Chinese either ethnically or by
citizenship affect anything biologically?
