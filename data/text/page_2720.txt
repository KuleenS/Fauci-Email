Subject: Your Expertise requested/COVID-19 Forum

Dear Dr. Fauci,

You have been kind enough to be a panelist on our Forums at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of
Public Health, and I wanted to see if you were available to participate remotely in a Forum that
we are organizing on March 2 about COVID-19.

The Forum will live stream on the websites of The World and The Forum, as well as on
Facebook and YouTube.

The World will send a journalist to moderate and co-promote.

The Forum is called "The Coronavirus Outbreak: Tracking COVID-19", presented jointly
with The World from PRX & WGBH.

Should you agree to participate, we ask that you join us remotely from 11:40am-1pm ET on
March 2; the actual live webcast will be noon-|pm ET.

We have been active is covering this outbreak. We did a highly successful Facebook Live Q&A
last week and are doing another Q&A next week.

As a reminder, Forum webcasts are one-hour long and are panel discussions, typically with 3-4
panelists, plus a moderator. As noted, these discussions are live streamed from our Leadership
Studio at our school in front of a studio audience (about 40 seats) and an online audience.
Anyone with an Internet connection can watch the live webcasts; no registration or fee is
required.
