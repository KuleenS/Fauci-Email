Subject: New NHP data on our vaccine for smallpox & monkeypox
Dear Tony,
| enjoyed your corona virus presentation at ASM Biothreats, and understand why you couldn’t linger.

I’m writing with an update on our horsepox-based vaccine program. On Wednesday, we presented a
poster on our further work with TNX-801 (horsepox) as a potential vaccine for smallpox and
monkeypox. We found that vaccination of cynos with TNX-801 resulted in sterilizing immunity (no
lesions) in 8/8 animals compared to a synthesized ACAM-like vaccinia which resulted in protection, but
lesions on 2/3 animals. More complete information is on the poster attached, which is available on our

website at (https://content.equisolve.net/tonixpharma/media/10929ac27f4fb5f5204f5cf41d59a121.pdf

). The press release is also attached and available on our website at (https://ir.tonixpharma.com/press-

releases/detail/1186).
