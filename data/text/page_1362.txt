Subject: RE: COVID-19 Response Corps

 

Hi all,

Updates:

1. Johns Hopkins and ASTHO released “A National Plan to Enable Comprehensive COVID-19 Case
Finding and Contact Tracing in the U.S.” calling for 100,000 contact tracers. (Kudos!) “Potential
workforce recruits may include... Peace Corps members.”

lan-to-enable-comprehensive-COVID-19-case-finding-and-contact-tracing-in-the-US. pdf

2. WaPo article: “A plan to defeat coronavirus finally emerges, but it’s not from the White House”
covers the JHU/ASTHO plan and notes: “Experts [CSIS] have proposed transforming the Peace
Corps into a national response corps that could perform many tasks, including contact tracing.”
[Not quite accurate. Peace Corps would be unchanged, but the evacuated volunteers would be
hired into COVID-19 response. |

3. NY Times editorial from Tom Frieden calls for a “giant public health effort.” “Recruits could
include Peace Corps volunteers who were brought home when the pandemic spread.”
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/opinion/cdc-coronavirus.html

4. Bill introduced by Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Chris Murphy (D-CT) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA)
would require federal agencies and departments facing special hiring needs during the
pandemic to establish a process to expedite hiring of returned Peace Corps volunteers

5. From March 29: Policy report from former FDA Commissioners Scott Gottlieb and Mark
McClellan calls for “massively” scaling contact tracing. “Surge the existing public-health
workforce to conduct case finding and contact tracing.” https://www.aei.org/research-
products/ report/ national-coronavirus-response-a-road-ma p-to-reopening/

6. Mark McClellan responded to my email yesterday: “I’d suggest adding outreach to mayors and
county execs if that hasn’t happened yet. They are really on the front lines for this next phase.”

7. |understand legislation is in the works, but don’t have details.

8. No news from FEMA or indication to my knowledge that they are planning a substantial ramping
up of staffing.

9. A key limitation on the impact of contact tracing will be the relative importance of
asymptomatic spread.
