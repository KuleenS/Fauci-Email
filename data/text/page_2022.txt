extreme pressures put on the health care system at this time. Many of us including myself would
be willing to work on site or what ever site you may need us the most, many us fully understand
that we could potentially be away from our families for an extensive unknown period of

time which we are ready for and pepared for or possibly put our health on the line too.

| implore you to give us a chance and only ask for special permission for OTJ in order to fully
finish our R.N. nursing degree.

Thank you for your time in reading this letter.

You are doing one fine heck of job in providing outstanding information and keeping the public
informed

Sincerely,

Ivan Bocardo
