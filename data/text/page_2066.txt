make sure people can get authoritative information from reliable sources and (2) encourage people to
practice social distance and give people ideas for doing this using internet tools. This will be live within
the next 48 hours.

As a central part of this hub, | think it would be useful to include a video from you because people trust
and want to hear from experts rather than just a bunch of agencies and political leaders. This could be
done in a number of formats if you're open to it. Probably best would be recording a Q&A where you
answer people's top questions, but we'd be open to other formats too.

I'm also doing a series of livestreamed Q&As with health experts to try to use my large following on the
platform (100 million followers) to get authoritative information out as well. I'd love to have you do one
of these Q&As. This could be the video we put in the Coronavirus Hub or it could be a different thing
that we distribute separately, but | think it could be effective as well.

Again, | know you're incredibly busy, so don't feel the need to respond if this doesn't seem helpful. If it's

easy to talk live, give me a call anytime on my mobile phone: [—__@) @.
Thanks again for everything you're doing.
