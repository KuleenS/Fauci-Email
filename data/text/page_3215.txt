That string of apparent gibberish is anything but: It’s a snippet of a DNA sequence from the viral
pathogen, dubbed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), that is overwhelming China and frightening the
entire world. Scientists are publicly sharing an ever-growing number of full sequences of the virus from
patients—53 at last count in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database. These viral
genomes are being intensely studied to try to understand the origin of 2019-nCoV and how it fits on the
family tree of related viruses found in bats and other species. They have also given glimpses into what
this newly discovered virus physically looks like, how it’s changing, and how it might be stopped.

“One of the biggest takeaway messages [from the viral sequences] is that there was a single
introduction into humans and then human-to-human spread,” says Trevor Bedford, a bioinformatics
specialist at the University of Washington, Seattle. The role of Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in
