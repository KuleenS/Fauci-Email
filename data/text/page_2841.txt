Dear Patricia,

Just following up from our phone conversation, unfortunately |
won't be able to facilitate a StudioGo truck for this interview.

We are still really keen to get Dr Fauci on the show — will he be
able to come to the bureau?

| will be able to book him a car if he needs.
Let me know what suits,
Best,

Joanna
