We have a room on the 11th. Ron is available and holding the date. Think time would work for you guys. Time
would be over lunch. Attendees arrive around 11:30 to grab lunch. Program starts at noon and runs to about I-
1:15. Of course, Tony is more than welcome to come in time for lunch. But he need not actually arrive until shortly
before noon so we can mike him up.

I might also try to get someone from CDC 1o round out the discussion. But if only Tony and Ron, we will run with
it. Also need to line up the moderator. But that shouldn’t be a problem. Would run options by you first.

Our comms team is really interested in pushing this --
