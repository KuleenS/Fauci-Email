Jeff:

Thanks for your note. It was very helpful to me to speak with your group last night. I caused
quite a stir at theTask Force meeting when | reported on our telephone conversation. I believe
that this fixed the FEMA issue.

Best regards,

Tony

Tony,

Thank you for taking some precious time to hear from some of the folks on the ground
confronting COVID-19 around the country. | can’t tell you how much we all value your
engagement and leadership on behalf of the nation. I’d love to get your take on whether
you think the types of things described it eh recent AE/ report are realistic. | have serious
doubts.

Quick question — ! mentioned the problem we had with FEMA test kits being recalled from
us because we did not want to use their call line and lab because too slow, — just
wondering if that came up in your meeting today because | just heard the kits were
released to us without restrictions on how we use them. So either way, apparently
resolved.

Stay well and best regards,

Jeff
