Subject: ASF: offer from Mark Zuckerberg

Per email below, Mark Zuckerberg has extended a few offers to do videos with you that we would be
happy to seek clearance on for you to do, if you are amenable. These would have the weight and impact
of television — really, more so. Please advise if you want to do and we will seek clearance with VP office
and work with Patty to sort out the logistics.

But an even bigger deal is his offer[____ OF
CjThe sooner we get that offer up the food-chain the better. | gave Bill Hall a heads-up about this
opportunity and he is standing by to discuss this with HHS and WH comms, but | didn’t want him to do
anything without you being aware of the offer. Is it OK if | hand this aspect off to Bill to determine who
the best point of contact would be so the Administration can take advantage of this offer, soonest?

Do you plan to call MZ? His cell number is in his message below.
