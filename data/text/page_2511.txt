Good morning! I made contact and it’s in the works! We even have them in our 20/20 special tomorrow night!

Question: do you think you could go live with me from NIH or WH one day next week for our Noon Coronavirus
show? It’s live steamed so we have millions of viewers. We would take viewer questions (1 would give you ahead of
time) and you would answer only those you want to.

It’s a half hour show , but we would do whatever amount of time your schedule allows.

It would be so impactful for the average viewer.
