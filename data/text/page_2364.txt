Subject: Countering COVID-19

Dr. Anthony Fauci
Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

Dear Dr. Fauci:

It occurred to me that if viruses contain an iron atom, perhaps a form of magnetic treatment might
stop or reduce the severity of the COVID-19 virus, so I investigated and found that viruscs have one atom
of iron. My suggestion is that experimentation on victims of the virus be conducted, perhaps by inserting
a tiny magnet into their lungs to see if it might gather up the viruses circulating in the victim. Perhaps
external application of magnetism would work as well, I'm sure your scientists will have even better
approaches to solving this problem. I'm a problem solver, having published a book that solves many of
the Earth’s problems: "Thinking Outside The Oven -- Concomitant Concepts and Synergistic Solutions
for the 21st Century” (available at Barnes & Noble and Amazon). I'm working on a sequel and if you
find my idea useful I'll include a chapter on it.

Very respectfully,
Ned Conger
