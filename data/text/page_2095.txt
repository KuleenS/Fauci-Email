There are natural ways to increase your EPO and there are drugs to trick your body
into producing more EPO. One of the best natural ways is high altitude training
(think Boulder, CO and Kenya marathon runners). Also, the risks involved in
increased red blood cell count obviously include stroke, blood clot, heart attack and
many others. But I think that if monitored closely and as a last resort this method
might help some people to survive this outbreak.

What is EPO?

Erythropoietin (EPO) is a naturally occurring hormone that stimulates the
production of red blood cells (RBC). Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein hormone
produced in the kidneys, containing a 165-amino acids structure. Most
erythropoietin is produced by the kidney’s renal cortex, but some is also produced in
the liver (mainly in the fetus), the brain and uterus.

Why is it important?
Erythropoietin production is stimulated by low oxygen levels in interstitial cells of

the peritubular capillaries in the kidneys. Following its production in the kidneys,
EPO travels to the bone marrow where it stimulates production of red blood cells
