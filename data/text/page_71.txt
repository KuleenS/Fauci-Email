Dr. Fauci:

Good morning.

I know you are busy, so forgive me for reaching out directly, but time is of the
essence.

I know you spoke with Jon about doing a 60 Minutes story on COVID-19.

We are interested in potentially crashing a story for this weekend.

Is it possible for us to have a quick brainstorming phone call on what such a story
might include if based at NIH with you?

Some ideas...

Following you closely as you engage in meetings, getting up to date info, giving
your opinion, going to task force meeting at WH or elsewhere.

Are you using the same “DNA platform” you showed us in the Zika story to build a
potential vaccine for COVID-19? Or is it another approach?

Will you be meeting with any patients who are currently infected? Bringing any
patients to the NIH for care/evaluation?

Let us know when you can talk.
Denise
