Hi,

I just wanted to follow up on this request for The Economist. The interview could
happen at Dr. Fauci's convenience.

Thanks for the consideration.

Best,

Dear Dr. Fauci,

“The Economist Asks", The Economist's award-winning interview podcast
would love to have you join the program this spring.

"The Economist Asks" is the Economist's flagship show, a current, frank
and engaging profile-style interview, in a series that includes heads of
state, cultural pioneers and business leaders, and hosted by Anne
McElvoy.

Anne would like to discuss with you, your thoughts on coronavirus, its
spread and the management of this global public health emergency.

We'd record 20 mins of interview, very flexible as to date and location -
though we'd love to do it soon - and are open to include subjects you feel
