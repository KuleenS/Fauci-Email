Caitlin/Judy:

| had a long and good conversation with Yasmeen Abutaleb and went over (and
countered) all of the issues that had any negative connotations for the Secretary
and/or the President. | spoke on the record and gave her permission to use my
quotes as she so wishes. Mission accomplished.
Best regards.,
Tony
