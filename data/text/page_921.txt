Hi Ninio,

We are wondering if Dr. Fauci would like to have a taped Skype conversation with PayPal CEO and
President Dan Schulman to talk about safety measures, health and science tied to COVID-19. We would
air the conversation during a global employee all hands to our 23,000 employees and then we could
syndicate parts of it externally on our social channels.

Thanks for any help in reaching Fauci’s team.

Thanks,
Amanda
