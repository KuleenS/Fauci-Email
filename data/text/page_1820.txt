Dear Tony,

| hope all is well. | had the great pleasure of meeting you in person when you were the
keynote speaker at our Cell Symposium on Emerging and Re-emerging Viruses in 2017. You
then gave a wonderful talk that covered AIDS to Zika and your experiences across different
outbreaks, administrations and the challenges you encountered.

 

My best wishes,
Sri.
