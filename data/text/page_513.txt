Dr. Fauci,

We wanted to send a quick note to thank you for joining us today. Your discussion with David was so
interesting and well received.

The coronavirus alone was on the minds of so many CEOs as it impacts their supply chain.

David, it goes without saying that you are the best interviewer! You make everything substantive and
entertaining.

Wishing everyone an enjoyable weekend!

Warmest regards,

Marlene
