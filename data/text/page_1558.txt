PNAS is pleased to announce that your paper "Projecting hospital utilization during the COVID-19
outbreaks in the United States" has published online at: www.pnas.org. Did you know article-level
metrics data and article downloads are now available for all PNAS articles? Article-level metrics provide
a new way of measuring the reach and impact of an article by tracking the mentions it receives online.
Clicking on the "Authors & Info" tab near the top of each article and scrolling down will reveal a
summary of mentions of the article across news sites, blogs, social media, and other online sources-
which are visualized in a colorful icon, or "badge." The number in the middle of the badge is the
Altmetric score, which is based on the volume, type, and author of the mentions. You can click on the
badge or "view more" to explore the individual mentions from each source. Article downloads by month
and by article format appear below the badge.
