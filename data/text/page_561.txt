Subject: quick question: when does an epidemic become a "pandemic" officially?

Dear Tony Fauci:

Hi! Busy times. Hope you are well. Can you explain to me how we will know if and when covid-19 has
become pandemic, versus whatever you'd call the current situation? Just in general, what’s the
definition of a pandemic?

Thank you...best, Joel

(and thanks for calling me back last weekend, sorry | missed you)
