Morgan:

Thanks for the note and the offer to help. It would be great if you could tweet to your many
Twitter followers that although the current risk of coronavirus to the American public is low,
the fact that there is community spread of virus in a number of countries besides China and
including South Korea, Japan, Italy, Iran among others poses a risk that we may progress toa
global pandemic of COVID-19. If that occurs we will surely have many more cases in the USA.
And so for that reason, the American public should not be frightened, but should be prepared
to mitigate an outbreak in this country by measures that include social distancing, teleworking,
temporary closure of schools, etc. There is nothing to be done right now since there are so few
cases in this country and these cases are being properly isolated, and so go about your daily
business. However, be aware that behavioral adjustments may need to be made if a pandemic
occurs.

Best regards,
Tony
