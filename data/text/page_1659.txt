MARCH 15:00 CEST

MESSAGE ON BEHALF OF THE GPMB CO-CHAIRS DR BRUNDTLAND AND MR SY
Dear GPMB Members,

Many thanks for your contributions to our teleconference, and to Jeremy and Victor for their very
helpful report on the GPMB COVID-19 advocacy.

Several of you mentioned that you had additional points that you might wish to make in writing; please
do so as soon as possible, copying them to all Board members.

If you have not already nominated a ‘sherpa’ to represent you in the informal support group that will
work with the secretariat, please do so as soon as possible. The secretariat is organizing a
teleconference with the informal support group to follow up on the direction given by the Board on the
annual report and work plan.

Kind regards,

Gro & As
GPMB Co-chairs
