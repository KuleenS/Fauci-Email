Tony,

lam so proud of you. It is so comforting to see your face on TV explaining the world of coronavirus. |
know it is exhausting for you but it is so important. Your dedication my friend has always been so
admirable.

Quick question, CDC isn’t giving much guidance on this. Our company has its annual retreat this week.
About 80 people coming from NYC and LA meeting in a DC Hotel ballroom for two days with an
additional 100 people from DC. SO approximately 180 in total. Would you postpone this if you were
me?
