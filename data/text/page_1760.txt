| spoke with Brad Sherman (D-CA) yesterday. He had originally reached out to
Tony, and Cliff Lane spoke to him Thursday, but | stepped in to try to lift one

task off of Tony’s plate.

He said he is sending a letter to Tony and me, asking what we need to go flat
out against COVID-19. He wanted to know who from my office his staff could

work with. I said you!
