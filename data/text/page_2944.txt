Dear Secretary Azar and Dr. Fauci,

| have read carefully the CDC's report issued this morning on the Wuhan virus (2019-nCoV)
epidemic originating in Wuhan, Hubei Province, PRC. The Report was prepared by CDC's best
Ph.D.s, M.D.s, and D.V.M.s See the pdf attached above for the complete report.

Below | have recorded what | think the most important facts in the report for Secretary Azar
and other federal officials who must stop the spread of 2019-nCoV in the U.S. by identifying all
infected persons and their contacts. | have also added my personal thoughts on how to stop
the spread of this novel coronavirus and a personal fear | have communicated to Secretary Azar
in the past:

-- President Trump signed an order preventing entry into the U.S. of any person who has
traveled to mainland China (PRC). Exceptions include U.S. citizens and permanent residents and
their families. Thank you Mr. Trump.

-- CDC maintains an office in the PRC. So information from Wuhan, Hubei, PRC, should be 'real
time’.

-- Enhanced screening of persons entering the U.S. is taking place at 18 ports and 5 airports.
The number of ports and especially airports needs to be increased. The Report states that
14,000 Chinese enter the U.S. daily. If the 5 airports receive 85% of these Chinese, then 2,100
Chinese enter the U.S. daily at other airports without enhanced screening.

-- CDC has developed its own RT-PCR test to detect 2019-nCoV in respiratory specimens. | have read
case reports where state laboratories have required too much proof of suspected Wuhan virus from
clinicians before performing RT-PCR testing of specimens. CDC should provide their improved RT-PCR
test to all states and HHS should insure that all states have sufficient equipment and trained
personnel for rapid turn-around time.
