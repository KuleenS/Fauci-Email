| know that it is frustrating for you, but they still have not changed the official number, even
though we know that it is certainly more than 44. Sorry.

Thank you Tony,

We heard this evening that there were 169 new confirmed cases aboard the cruise ship. Do you know if
this changes the “official public” number at all?

Thanks,
Colin

Colin:

Thanks for the note. The number 44 is in flux. When | checked a couple of days ago, the
“official public’ number was 44. However, it was clear that there was likely more than that
since the results of the tests were still coming back on some individuals. And so, itis a
minimum of 44 infected from the cruise ship, but it is uncertain how many more than 44 are
infected. | donot know where the Americans are staying
Best,

Tony
