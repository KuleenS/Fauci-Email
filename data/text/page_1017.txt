Dear Francis, Anthony, Cliff, Christopher, David, Maria, and Lawrence,
| hope you are all well. Attached is the updated set of four proposals on:

1) Rapid repurposing of antiviral drugs to treat COVID-19;

2) Expedited development of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to treat COVID-19;

3) Rapid COVID-19 vaccine development;

4) Risk-reduced ways to reopen schools and businesses, and the healthcare system changes that are
needed to enable them.

We hope you find these updated proposals useful, and would be happy to engage in any way that could
be helpful.

Sincerely yours,
