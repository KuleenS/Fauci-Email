Subject: Announcement--ASM's COVID-19 Research Registry

 

 

Dear Tony and NIAID friends —

the mission of the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) to promote and advance the microbial
sciences has perhaps never been more clearly in focus than during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Accelerating basic research is key to ASM’s mission— it is where cure and prevention begin. It is
impressive how rapidly research on SARS-CoV-2 /COVID-19 has advanced in just a few weeks, but
easily accessing new and relevant research has been a challenge for basic researchers. When ASM's
Council on Microbial Sciences held a COVID-19 summit to identify the most significant scientific work on
the virus, the coronavirus researchers and clinical microbiologists raised the need for the scientific
community to curate important COVID-19 research.

ASM is excited to announce the launch of the COVID-19 Research Registry, a platform curated
and vetted by experts in the field of virology and related disciplines to provide immediate access
to top COVID-19 research.

| am proud that Lynn Enquist, Ph.D., Henry L. Hillman Professor in Molecular Biology, Princeton
University and former ASM President, will serve as Chief Curator for this Registry. Dr. Harold Varmus,
Lewis Thomas University Professor of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine has agreed to join us as Chief
Consultant on the project.

We are honored to have the following as Assistant Curators-in-Chief:
e Rozanne M. Sandri-Goldin, Ph.D., Chancellor's Professor, Microbiology & Molecular Genetics,
University of California, Irvine and Editor-in-Chief of ASM’s Journal of Virology
e Vaughn Cooper, Ph.D., Professor, Microbiology & Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh,
and current ASM Board member

The entire curatorial board is listed on the Registry site.
