HI Dr. Fauci,

 
 

) (6) you diagnosed with AIDS back in the mid 1980's.

It was in those early days of the AIDS epidemic that you were instrumental in diagnosing and researching this
dreadful disease.

 

My family had been associated with the NCI through my uncle, Lou Wasserman, who was a researcher for a period
of time. Lou did much research on polycythemia vera and was a hemotologist at Mt. Sinai in NYC. I'm glad that
he's no longer around to witness the devastation of Covid-19.

I was impressed with your knowledge at the time of [[@) @diagnosis and [ am even more so in these times of the
Covid-19 pandemic. Thanks for being the intelligent and informative face of the facts on the virus. There are many
around the country who rely on your wisdom but also on your facts and data.

Stay well, stay healthy, and keep providing the country with what we need to know and do.

Best,

NIH-000019
