Hello all - Clearly, the most important
thing of all is a reliable, real-time
diagnostic test that can differentiate
between flu and COVID-19. CDCs test
kits were recalled because states said
they were not working. Now they have
to remanufacture the faulty reagent.
How long will that take? If and when
more kits are available, will they be
available in sufficient quantity that all
health care providers will have access?

In all of this, I have not heard anyone
talk about the Nanopore MinION
technology that has been used for
Ebola. What gives??? It is field
deployable and can be run in-house.
Hospital labs can run thousands of
samples at once. It gives results of all
viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi, in 2
hours. We all know this technology is
quite promising. Why aren’t we going
gangbusters to validate this rapid
technology and get it to all
diagnosticians? If ever there was a time
to invest in a diagnostic technology,
this is it!
