Donald:

You not only got it right, but it was an extraordinarily comprehensive, informative and
sobering article. | do not agree with everything that is being done by various countries, and
you have indicated that many of these approaches are controversial. However, your reporting
of them is accurate and well-articulated. Bottom line is that this is an outstanding article.

Best,
Tony
