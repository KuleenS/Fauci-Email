Subject: Covid-19 symptoms outside of China
Dear Dr. Fauci,

Many insist on coughs as one of the requirements for self-isolation or testing for covid-19. However, | have read
about instances where coughs were not experienced by those who tested positive.

Is it possible to share a list of covid-19 symptoms that *exclude* the patients in China and perhaps France due to
their fairly high number of smokers? Does coughing remain a symptom? I am concerned about the health of our

nursing home residents, as well as the financial well-being of service sector workers.

Thank you,
Winnie
