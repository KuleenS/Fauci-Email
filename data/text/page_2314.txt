Carissimo Dr. Fauci -

Greetings from Munich, Germany! It's hard to believe so many years have passed since
our time working avian influenza preparedness. I have watched every single interview
during the past few months and I could not be more relieved to see you at the helm of
this new, rapidly evolving crisis.

I know you have very little time, so I will make this quick - hopefully to be followed by a
more fulsome and proper hello.

We have a prominent American businessman (age 64) here in Munich who tested
positive a little over a week ago after skiing in the Dolomites in Italy. He has a history
of respiratory illnesses, including double pneumonias and various other similar
complications. In short, he is sedated and intubated, and was placed on ECMO during
the past 24 hours. The team is administering ritonavir and lopinavir, as well as broad
spectrum antibiotics.

The German doctor here would like to acquire Remdesivir to have on hand if all other
treatments fail. Because it is not being tested here, he inquired whether we could
access it in the States. Would you be able to point me in the right direction for how, if
even possible, we could transfer some to the Munich-based hospital here?

Thank you so much in advance. Any other insights of course are certainly welcome.
You continue to be a national treasure. All the best - Rita
