Subject: ASF: daily data call from Sec Ofc

 

 

Per request from the Secretary's office that | sent you this morning, below is what | propose to submit
tomorrow morning for the new daily 9am data call. | will plan to submit pretty much the same thing every
day. | will not clog your in-box with it unless there is a significant update.

RFI from Staff Sec:

1. For tomorrow’s press conference, what information or topics do you
recommend be included in the President’s remarks? Please provide talking
point-level details and support.

Nothing specific from NIAID at this time.

2. For tomorrow’s press conference, on what information (if any) do you
intend to speak?

Specific topics will depend on questions from reporters. Dr. Fauci has been asked about the effect of
social distancing; considerations that would factor into returning the country to normal life; off-label
use of treatments such as hydrochloroquine; the status of clinical trials; and the disproportionate
impact of COVID-19 on communities of color.

NIAID-specific talking points:

e NIAID has mobilized a rapid research response to quickly develop effective
countermeasures for COVID-19, including diagnostics, vaccines to prevent
disease and treatments.
