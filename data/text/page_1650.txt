and leaving a facility to which the general public has access, it could become possible to prevent most
smear infections by decontaminating all hands prior and after each possible contamination, both active
or passive. In addition, the measure should massively reduce transmission of other viruses and bacteria
currently burdening differential diagnosis of COVID-pneumonias. Based on the excellent experiences
made with the acceptability and adherence during Ebola outbreaks, repeated mandatory hand hygiene
or sanitation should thus become an almost unconscious routine of everyday life for any person having
to leave his or her private home in Corona-affected countries.

| have been asked by senior WHO emergency management to promote the WHO recommendation for
rapid implementation with particular focus on current COVID-19 transmission epicenters such as the
USA. Providing a systematic access to hand hygiene stations and making their use obligatory prior to
entering and whenever leaving any public facility will also provide a safety net whenever current
restrictions on movements and commerce are to be progressively reduced. Given the high resource
settings in the current COVID-epicentres, and the negligible cost of implementing this public health
emergency measure compared to prolonged mass confinement without safe exit strategy, | do presume
that the wherewithal to carry it out will not be limiting factor.

Thank you for considering the collaboration in this emergency measure proposed within the USA at the
largest possible scale. WHO has requested IFRC to alert the American Red Cross to support large scale
implementation should your Government decide to implement the public health measure proposed.

With best wishes for success in all of your endeavours,
Stefan Hoyer
