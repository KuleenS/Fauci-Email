Subject: Varicella vaccine-COVID-19 connection

 

Dr. Fauci,

Is it possible that the varicella vaccine could be playing a role in why children are not presenting with the
COVID-19 virus? If the vaccine became common around 1995, we would be seeing little to no infection
of children and young adults up to about 2S years old, which seems to be the case. Could something in
the varicella vaccine have provided immunity to COVID-19?

Just an idea from a concerned citizen...
Thank you for your remarkable leadership during this crisis.

Sincerely,
Rose Marie Codling
