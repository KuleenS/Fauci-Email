Slr,

I appreciate the effort of your entire team in identification and resolution of the
predicament the chinese government has gotten us into. That said, I believe you
might add a more proactive edge by mining existing data. You're going to have to
dig deep.

It seems that the common denominator in originating vector, at least by your news
releases, is plainly travel-related co-mingling of persons not otherwise in

contact. Therefore, I would propose that there is a great trove of existing data
waiting to be filtered within the travel manifests’ history of US-bound airlines and
US-bound cruise vessels. Suggest as a start the collection of every manifest from the
last 4 months or so, filtered and compared with principle contractees known to exist
in the US, and list every other person on said aircraft/vessel that disembarked on US
soil. DO NOT WAIT FOR PEOPLE TO GET SICK - Employ the National Guard
and Coast Guard to track these folks and put a swab in their nose. If positive, then
contact trace this smaller group. If negative maintain them on the list and force
compliant reporting if they develop suspected symptoms.

I know it would seem to be a lot of work. However, I presume your are familiar with
the FRAM Oil Filter Guy from the 1970s, where it's better to pay now than

later because you're going to pay one way or another. Get a proactive jump on
DETECTION, IDENTIFICATION, CONTROL. We're burning daylight.
Respectfully submitted,

Dennis J. Malone
