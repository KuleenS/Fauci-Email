Hi Tony,

Quick question — who would you suggest is the appropriate NIH representative for this ASPR-led
trans-HHS effort to coordinate COVID-19 response? You and | will be testifying in front of the
House Approps Subcommittee on Wednesday morning. Would it be best for Larry to represent
NIH for the ASPR gathering (though he would normally attend the House hearing), or is there
someone from NIAID that would be most appropriate?

Thanks, Francis
