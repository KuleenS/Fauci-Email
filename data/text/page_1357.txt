of COVID-19. Our effort to contain the spread of the virus had been effective so far
with 296 cases of COVID-19 and 3 lethal cases reported up to now.

We are impatiently awaiting results of vaccine and therapeutic trials supported by
NIAID, which I am confident will help to defeat this pandemic disease. On our side,
Georgia is committed to make its modest but important contribution to the global
efforts.

Sincerely,
