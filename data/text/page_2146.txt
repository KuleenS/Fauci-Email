Jewish congregation in Chicago which holds services thrice daily. Due to the tight-nit nature of the larger Jewish
community, many synagogues in the city and surrounding suburbs have closed indefinitely in order to limit the
community spread of the Covid-19 virus. (One person visiting the community from New York and who interacted
with numerous individuals has so far tested positive.) Our synagogue is few in parishioners though is an essential
sanctum of sustenance and faith to those who make usage of its services. We would like to keep our doors open for
the longest duration possible but remain cognizant of the realities of the pandemic. Considering that we gather in a
sanctuary of impressive size with usually no more than 20 members who are stationed at a distance apart from one
anothcr, would it be responsible to continuc services for the remainder of the week and this upcoming Sabbath so
long as no specific member of the congregation itself has contracted the virus?
