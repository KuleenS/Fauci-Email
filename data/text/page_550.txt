Dear Dr Fauci:

We've had a lot of discussion around our COVID-19 session today. An idea that came up was possibly
having you do something remotely. Either a live feed in from your office at approximately 1:05 PM to
1:20 PM EDT on Tuesday, March 10 if you have that time available, or have you send in a video recorded
presentation a day or 2 before that we can show at the session. Having some way to communicate the
high priority NIH/NIAID has on developing a vaccine and treatment would help bring the content
together.

We know this is likely not possible, with the very short notice and your even more tremendously busy
schedule around all of this. But it’s worth the ask.

Please let me know if you think either of these is possible. And Patty, sorry for butchering your email
address earlier.

Best,

Donna
