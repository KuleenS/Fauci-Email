Subject: Community-Spread Covid-19 Contact Tracking
Dear Dr. Fauci:

Without success, for more than a week, | have tried to reach any techie CDC person about the problem of
community-spread Covid-19 contact tracking.

Though your workload is unimaginable, | thought you might personally know and could provide contact
information of an appropriate CDC or NIH epidemiologist.

***Brief Summary of Concept***skip to End, if obvious***
Had | been to a doctor or ER with a virulent disease, they would immediately have asked where | had
been, with whom, and for what duration. With that information, epidemiologists can notify and test those

contacts... and their contacts... before their symptoms are evidenced.

This manual contact tracking process is workload intensive, calendar-day wasting, data-poor, and
inaccurate.

“Location tracking" can provide the raw data needed to identify potential contacts automatically, early, and
thoroughly, from information routinely collected by network providers.

The location, at a date and time, of a vast number of anonymous cell phones, over the preceding two
weeks, would be very useful for identifying the index case and subsequent contacts of an individual.

As an illustration, the New York Times published, on 19 December 2019, "Twelve Million Phones, One
Dataset, Zero Privacy” about the commercial location tracking industry:

***End of Summary***

Ignoring the techie and legal details, can you suggest an appropriate contact, while Covid-19 infections in
the United States are few?

Your continuing dedication, candor, and data-driven focus are refreshing and very much appreciated, Dr.
Fauci.

Best,

John G. Boland
