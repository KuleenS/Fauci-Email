and on the second day the meeting will be open for several peer reviewers including Stanley
Plotkin and Andy Pollard to review and comment on possible small and NHP animal models as
well as appropriate immunologic testing to be done in early phase one trials.

| am wanted to make you aware of the meeting so that you could attend all or part as an
observer if you wish but also to invite you to consider joining on day two as one of our formal
