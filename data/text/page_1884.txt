Subject: Meeting on the science of COVID-19, Wed. 3/25, 2-Spm

 

 

Colleagues,

I’m glad to hear that most of you are able to join a three-hour virtual meeting on
Wednesday March 25 to discuss scientific opportunities in the effort to conquer the
COVID-19 pandemic. While NIAID rightly has the lead in this effort for NIH, and is deeply
invested in projects in both their intramural and extramural programs, it’s clear that a
number of other ICs have creative ideas and a strong motivation to try to help with this
global crisis. So this certainly seems like a time where we should gather (virtually of course)

NIH-000277
