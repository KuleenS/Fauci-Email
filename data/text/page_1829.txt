Patty:

| know Tony is the expert, but | thought this memo would be of interest and perhaps of help to him in
his battles.

The attached memo is from Dr. Paul Offit (U of Penn} and a colleague of his David Rubin. Tony may know
him, | would not be surprised.

But for you, Paulis one of the country’s topic vaccinologists and virologists. Paul developed a vaccine for
a deadly disease. | know him well and he’s the real deal. Next to Tony he is my go to science source.

Paul in particular is a highly credible, well known national expert.

They wrote this memo on the 19" of March and it has many suggestions that are incredibly smart and |
thought tony would want to see this immediately. Paul and David are obviously available to talk asap.

Let me know.

Bill
