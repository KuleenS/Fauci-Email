Dr Fauci,

| hope all is well with you. |am a Dermatologist practicing in the Metropolitan
Detroit area. | have done some literature searching on potential treatments
for the novel coronavirus and stumbled across a few case case reports from
China in 2005 at the time of the SARS outbreak. They detailed some
successes in treatment of severe cases with chloroquine. | saw a more
recent study showing hydroxychloroquine had better in vitro efficacy than
chloroquine. Have you heard of this? Plaquenil is so innocuous, | wonder if
we shouldn't just try it.

| think you are doing phenomenal work and really presenting a level,
measured and realistic view of this epidemic to the world. Please keep up
the great work. It is much appreciated
