Dear Dr. Anthony Fauci,

It was a great pleasure meeting you all a couple of years ago when we were both speaking
at the Aspen Ideas Festival. Some of my contacts at the CDC recently briefed me about the
rapidly emerging threat of the coronavirus to the US and have been urging us to develop
an app for detecting coronavirus with high sensitivity and specificity on our Gene-RADAR
platform. Our platform has the ability to quantify viral loads in ‘real-time’ which would be a
much more precise and accurate solution in deciding quarantine than the current
thermometers or even the current CDC coronavirus test which has a very poor Limit of
detection (ie low sensitivity).

We have a strong track record of responding to previous pandemic threats and rapidly
building Gene RADAR applications for Ebola and Zika and then getting them through
clinical validation as per the the FDA EVA approval process. Our Gene-RADAR Zika test was
FDA EUA certified right as the Zika crisis was coming to an end.

| would love to work with you to see how we can help in your efforts to rapidly respond to
this deadly threat to the US and the world. Here are some of the capabilities of our
platform that we believe could be an enabler for helping to stop this out break from
becoming a full-fledged global pandemic.
