Dear Doctor Fauci,

I am a pediatrician from [@) 4 (IT).

I was wondering if high doses of vitamin A have been tried in the therapy of COVID-19.

Do you remember the cases of viral pneumonia due to measles that take place in African infants in the late seventies.
It seemed to work.

Many sorry to bother you.

Have a good job!

Best regards
