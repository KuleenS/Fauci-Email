Subject: LHHS Hearing w/ Dr. Fauci -

- Wednesday, May 6

Hi Adrienne,
| hope you're doing well.

I’m reaching out because Chair
DeLauro would like to invite Dr. Fauci
to a hearing next Wednesday, May 6,
with the House LHHS appropriations
subcommittee. The focus of the
hearing, not surprisingly, would be
COVID-19. Members of the
subcommittee would very much like
to hear from Dr. Fauci on anything
related to COVID-19, but | think the
main topics would be:
e Mitigation and Testing; and
e Progress on vaccines,
therapeutics, and
diagnostics, as well as
necessary preparations to
manufacture and
disseminate a vaccine once it
is ready.
