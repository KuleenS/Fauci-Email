Thank you my friend, hope it leads to something good for patients and the public.

| was at a meeting of the “Philosophical Society of Texas” this week end and meet with a
lot of Bush alums like Don Evans and Margaret Spellings etc and Margaret was
commenting on the coronavirus scare and how fortunate we are to have you there at NIH
looking after us!! If you ever decide to relocate to Texas you have a fan club here!

All my best

Andy
