Subject: Attn Dr. Fauci: Key Points for Congressional Black Caucus Briefing Call - Monday 11:30a.m.

 

Dr. Fauci,

On Monday, April 13", at 11:30 a.m., you are scheduled to participate in an
informal discussion/telebriefing regarding health disparities and COVID-19 with
members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC). Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA,
including Oakland and Berkeley) — former CBC chair — made the request. A list of
expected call participants is below the signature line of this email.

| have attached a “one-pager” to provide some background on health disparities
and COVID-19 that includes information on NIH COVID-19 research that may be
relevant to the discussion. As you are aware, we do not have any COVID-19
studies directly focused on the African American community. Hilary and Greg
have provided input.

Please let me know if | can be of further assistance (Chase cell:[—__-©@))

Thanks,
Chase
