It seems COVID-19 causes greater problems for the elderly and those with chronic illnesses, as you have
said.

Why not try giving those with active disease, or those at risk, gamma-globulin, to ameliorate the effects
of the illness?

It would be especially interesting to prepare batches of gamma globulin using the blood (2,000- 3,000
donors) of people who have, or who have recovered from, COVID-19 infection.

There is ample precedent for using Gammaz-globulin to prevent or treat viral illnesses (Hepatitis A, B) or
diseases of unknown etiology (ie Kawasaki’s).

This could be useful especially while we wait for the development of a vaccine.

What do you think?
