bject: Invitation for an expert panel webinar on the role of micronutrients and coronavirus

Dear Dr. Fanci,

I would like to address you for an expert panel webinar on the role of micronutrients and
coronavirus

Due to the new coronavirus outbreak and the rapidly escalating global spread, lots of questions
are raised regarding the role of micronutrients in supporting the immune system. DSM has
reached out to me with a request to organize rapidly a focused expert panel in order to
establish expert guidance summarizing key points with respect to the role of micronutrients in
supporting our body’s immune response, in light of the current general consciousness that
among other factors nutrition is important in combatting infectious diseases. Peter Van Dael,
head of Nutrition Science & Advocacy, is responsible for the coordination of this activity at
DSM.

I agreed to take on this challenge and therefore intend to organize this expert panel through
webinar in order to manage the challenges related to busy agendas and travel within the next
week, if possible. The webinar is expected to last for about 3 hours maximum and would be
facilitate through the distribution of a short background document | will share in order to
facilitate the discussion.

I will try to reach out to you tomorrow by phone in order to review whether you would be
available for this engagement and whether you would you have potential questions prior to
agreeing to participate.

With our best regards,

Manfred Peter
