Subject: The National Organization of Italian Americans in Film & Television (NOIAFT) - Interview
Request

Dear Dr. Fauci,

| hope this email finds you well. My name is Taylor Taglianetti and | am the founder of the National
Organization of Italian Americans in Film & Television (NOIAFT).

Our organization is so very proud of the work you are doing for our country and sends tremendous
thanks for the hope and reassurance you have instilled during these trying times.

It would be an honor to conduct a short interview with you. Our organization includes many young
Italian Americans breaking into the entertainment industry and with the coronavirus dramatically
impacting our field, I'd love to ask you a few questions about what the future of the

entertainment business looks like. We'd be happy to send the questions in advance for your approval. If
you don't have time for a phone call, the questions can be answered via email at your leisure.
