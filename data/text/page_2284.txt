Subject: NIH ketone ester for Coronavirus treatment?

Dear Dr. Fauci

There was a paper recently showing a ketogenic diet helped tame the general flu, in
mice.

Meanwhile, there is a drink developed via DARPA and NIH (Dr Veech) that mimics
the benefits of the diet. It 1s called a ketone ester. Even shown to block effects of
nuclear bomb style radiation (LD-70 to 100% survival).

Who can I soak to about testing this drink on mice for the general flu , or even
humans with Coronavirus symptoms?

Can I send you the paper?
Thank you,
Frank Llosa
