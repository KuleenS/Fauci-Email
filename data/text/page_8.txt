There is no way of knowing for sure. | would wait until May and see what the dynamics of the
outbreak are globally and make your decision then whether or not to cancel.

Subject: Conference Planning with respect to coronavirus.

Dear Dr. Fauci

Dr. Miriam Kelty formerly of NIH referred me to you. | am on the board of directors and planning
committee of the Applied Superconductivity Conference that is planned to be held in Tampa, Florida the
last week of July. Over 50% of our expected 1500 attendees are from outside the continental US. Our
planning committee appears to have three options:

1. Hold the conference on the original dates

2. Postpone the conference a few months

3. Cancel the conference

It would be most helpful to decision process if you can give us a prediction (anonymously of course) of
how the effects of the virus will pan out.

| look forward to your reply.
