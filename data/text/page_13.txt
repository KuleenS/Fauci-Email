Hello:

| wanted to make sure you are still considering our request for Dr. Ashton and David Muir to interview
Dr. Fauci for our 2 hour program ABC News 20/20 Friday from 9pm to 11pm.

If a remote interview from a studio-on-the go mobile unit is preferable we can certainly arrange that.
Thank you for your consideration.

Keep up with our latest on the developing novel coronavirus outbreak:
