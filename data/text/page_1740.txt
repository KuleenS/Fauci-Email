Given the scope of the meeting and the attendees and industries they represent, | think that a lecture
on pandemics, bioterrorism and emerging infectious disease, especially in light of COVID-19, is
necessary. | think you would teach new concepts to a team of doctors that would identify with some of
the system gaps in our current supply chain and their impact on human health, wellbeing and survival.
You’d provide experience and insight on what went wrong and what could be fixed in the future to make
us collectively better prepared.

We would be honored to have you speak and I’m glad to continue discussion of logistics with someone
else on your team. If you needed more information about scope, | can certainly provide that. We do
provide an honorarium and will cover travel and hotel expenses.

Thanks so much in advance for any consideration you might give this request/offer and most of all thank
you for your direction, demeanor and dedication at this global time of crisis.

Best,
Paulo
