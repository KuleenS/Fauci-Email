| have an idea to HELP with the MASK SHORTAGE!

Please don’t disregard this, as this could help our whole country!

| know we are concerned as a nation about a mask shortage and | have an idea to what might help.

| Don’t know who to go to that can help implement this and want your input if you think this is a viable
aid, then maybe you can help me reach the right people to make the biggest impact, maybe even up to
the Coronavirus team in the White House.

| have CF & when | first heard about China quarantining 43 million people | got
worried about masks, | looked up how to sew a mask for myself & family. | found a site that talked about
sewing masks for cancer treatment patients and to use 100% quilters cotton for outside & 100% flannel
cotton on inside. | started sewing several. | know they aren’t the N95, but they are better than nothing
IF needed. My Dr just told me yesterday not to go anywhere without a mask because it’s too much of a
risk for my health. It got me thinking. What if while people across the country were in home quarantine,
ALL those who know how to sew, they sew these masks to donate in their communities. Not for use
against Coronavirus, but for other things normal masks are used (food prep, non-sickness mecical
reasons, etc) then they aren’t using up the valuable higher rated masks that are needed for doctors,
nurses & first responders fighting Coronavirus. These masks can also be washed as needed again and
again which will just keep saving other masks.

During the WH Press Release this morring, Seema expresses the need for masks & Dr Birx explained
how the virus is being spread from surfaces, but that it can’t survive in fabric. Which means maybe these
cloth masks will even help against the spread of the virus.

Either way, if you can help ok for these to be used in some manner vs a medical mask being used will
help prolong the need for more masks and hopefully 3M can have more made by then so we never have
to experience an lack of masks.

What do you think?
