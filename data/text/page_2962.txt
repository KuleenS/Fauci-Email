Nancy:

The official USG group will be convened by NAS. Bob Kadlec is the person with
direct knowledge of that. In addition, there is an ad hoc group informally led by
Jeremy Farrar of Wellcome Trust. This group has about 15 people, all of whom
are highly respected scientists, mostly evolutionary biologists who are convening
by e-mail and conference calls (I have been on 2 of these calls since Jeremy
invited me) to look at all of the bat, pangolin and human coronavirus sequences
to try and determine the evolutionary origin. This is not my area of expertise and
so | have backed off and am leaving it all to Jeremy.

Best,
Tony
