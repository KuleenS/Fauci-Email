The International mRNA Health Conference is a yearly non-profit event collaboratively
organized by Curevac, BioNTech and Moderna. It brings together academic and industry
thought leaders in the mRNA design and delivery space to explore the rapidly evolving science,
business and regulatory landscape of mRNA medicines. Over the last seven years, this 2-day
conference has become the premier destination for industry and academic professionals to
network with colleagues, learn about the latest advances in MRNA technology, and to attend
scientific presentations given by the most esteemed experts in the field. Notably, it is the only
annual conference dedicated solely to mRNA therapeutics.

As a scientist with tremendous experience and the director of NIAID, the organizing
committee thought that conference attendees would very much appreciate hearing about
your thoughts about mRNA therapeutics, particularly vaccines, and any perspectives you
wish to share.

The organizing committee recognizes that your calendar is likely filled years in advance, but we
all have our fingers crossed that you might be able to fit this into your busy schedule.

| look forward to hearing from you.

all best wishes,

Norbert

P.S. In the event that the COVID-19 crisis ts still curtailing travel in the fall, our backup plan
would be to have a completely virtual meeting on the same dates. We plan to make that
decision in late August/early September.
