 

Barring the institution of any extreme travel restrictions, | am planning to visit the Bethesda area next
week (Macrogen U.S. HQ is located in Rockville). | know you are extraordinarily busy but if you (or key
colleagues) have time, | and other senior Macrogen colleagues would be happy to discuss the project, its
necessary next steps, along with any other matters related to Korea as you wish. [Please note that | do
not have any clinical symptoms or signs of Covid-19 nor any relevant contact history.]

Thank you very much for your attention to this matter and | hope that we may have a chance to advance
this important project together.

Please take care and thanks again,

Ogan
