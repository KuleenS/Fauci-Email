Subject: Specific Questions About CoronaVirus

 

Hi Dr. Fauci, you might not remember me from my previous email. I'm a Brazilian who asked you some
months ago about the influenza virus differences across regions. | recently traveled to DC and NY and
had a great time there (before the Corona Virus outbreak)

| have some specific questions about the new Corona Virus, and would be very grateful if you can
answer them:

1- Using available data, I've made a simple spreadsheet attempting to predict the virus

behavior: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DAHQOtFzX0-
FKU405k8p864JBVHAIfzsHOghuywaTNbE/edit#eid=0

I've used exponential trend, although it seems to be spreading slower than the expected, I'd like to
know if there's an accurate model for predicting this virus. Also, | assume virus don't always spread
exponentially?

2- | listened to your interview podcast https://edhub.ama-assn.org/jn-learning/audio-player/18197306.
Really amazing content. Let's assume this is going to be a worldwide outbreak. How can | get prepared
for the worst? Buy water, dry food, stay indoors, withdraw money, etc?

Once again, I'd like to thank you very much for reading this email. | bet this is a very busy time for you,
so it means alot to me

Thank you,

Rafael
