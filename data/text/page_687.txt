Summary

We have developed an analysis pipeline to facilitate real-time mutation tracking in SARS-CoV-2, focusing
initially on the Spike (S) protein because it mediates infection of human cells and is the target of most
vaccine strategies and antibody-based therapeutics. To date we have identified fourteen mutations in
Spike that are accumulating. Mutations are considered in a broader phylogenetic context,
geographically, and over time, to provide an early warning system to reveal mutations that may confer
selective advantages in transmission or resistance to interventions. Each one is evaluated for evidence
of positive selection, and the implications of the mutation are explored through structural modeling. The
mutation Spike D614G is of urgent concern; it began spreading in Europe in early February, and when
introduced to new regions it rapidly becomes the dominant form. Also, we present evidence of
recombination between locally circulating strains, indicative of multiple strain infections. These finding
have important implications for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, pathogenesis and immune interventions.
