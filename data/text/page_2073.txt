My lab is based in New Orleans where the number of COVID19 cases is now growing fast.
However, there is no sign from the university or my institute to close. We are working as usual
with only some mild restrictions even if we have colleagues that are at home sick, or worse,
that showed up at work coughing. The city mayor applied some restrictions but the people are
still celebrating events on the street. Up to today we were acknowledged that we have a
presumptive positive case in the building where we live. We are doing what we can as
responsible individuals but tomorrow we will go to work again not knowing if we are spreading
the virus.

| thank you for reading this email and | hope my arguments are solid and accurate enough to
encourage you to take action.

Best wishes,
Giulia
