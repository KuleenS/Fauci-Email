Dr. Fauci; i attended a small water seminar, put on by local (Seventh Day Adventist) medical profes-
sionals, in the mid 1970's at Elms Haven, California.

This seminar taught the participants how to eliminate the flu with the use of water treatments, ie
(steam baths, etc).

| have now for these past 40 some-odd years, been taking two treatment's; one in the evening and
another in the middle of the night, whenever | have contacted the flu: AND have had the facilities to do
so; and each time | was well the next morning. No temperature, no symptoms whatsoever.

With the high rate that this Coronavirus is spreading, one can see what a great tool these treatments
can be for medical professionals. To have those who are sick with the flu, completely free of all
symptoms after two treatments would greatly ease the burden on Dr's and other medical professionals
AND each facility.
