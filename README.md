# FAUCI Emails OCR
A little script I developed to make text documents for look up for the Fauci Emails\
Do what you want with the text data
## Steps Involved
1. Downloaded the PDF version from Buzzfeed 
2. Here is the link: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20793561-leopold-nih-foia-anthony-fauci-emails
3. Split up the PDFs into single pages as one file is too big to read
4. convert each page to jpg
5. use tesseract for OCR
