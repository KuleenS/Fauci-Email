# FAUCI Emails OCR
A little script I developed to make text documents for look up for the Fauci Emails\
Do what you want with the text data
## Steps Involved
1. Downloaded the PDF version from Buzzfeed (already here for you)
2. Split up the PDFs into single pages as one file is too big to read
3. convert each page to jpg
4. use tesseract for OCR
